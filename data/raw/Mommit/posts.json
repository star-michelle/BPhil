Baby is 5.5 months and doesn't sleep well and doesn't like left alone to play even if I'm in the same room. Husband currently works from home and I've never been left alone with baby for more than a few hours. I'm honestly freaking out.\n\nAny tips on how to get things done? How do I shower or cook or clean? \n\nI really struggle to let him cry and not pick him up, I get really stressed and teary. Do I need to practice that? Any tips in that area?\n\nI could maybe afford a nanny once a week for a few hours and my mum can help on some weekends. I don't have many friends but the ones I have work mon-fri and don't have kids theirselves.\n\nAny tips would be really appreciated"

So I poked and danced around it trying to get it out of him.\n\nTurns out someone asked him if I used our son as a baby trap. Of course I didn’t, we just weren’t safe about sex in the beginning of our rekindled relationship. He said part of him believes it to be true. He won’t tell me who said it (not that it matters but of course I want to know so as to not have that kind of toxic person in my life.)\n\nNever have I ever considered or used my son as a trap and I kept him (as opposed to abortion) out of pure love. \n\nI feel so betrayed because for him to think that about me I think is so insulting, it took two of us to get me pregnant, and we said before I even was pregnant that we knew we wanted to get married. We talked about children but never would we have thought it would happen so soon.\n\nHe just kept looking at me as in tears heartbroken and I told him I’m definitely not okay with him at the moment. I honestly am considered breaking up with him over just this just to prove him wrong. I love him, and we talked about having more children and getting married after having our baby. He’s a great father and boyfriend but how can I look at him the same after this?\n"

I am going to the school but what would you expect the outcome to be, to fix it?  I feel guilty but my kid basically took being assaulted because 1) my kid doesn't have a Mena bone in her body 2) it's a private school where they drill into the kids and families that it's zero tolerance on bullying and violence & 3) my kid knows she is different & feel sorry for her.... and for all that- she won't react. So assuming the issue falls on the school, what would you expect them to do to fix it realistically?  Ty guys"

To say niece is spoiled is an understatement. They are just the type of people that will live paycheque to paycheque buying frivolous stuff and spend a mortgage payment on their kid for Christmas.\n\nThis is the first year we are doing Christmas morning together in a very long time and haven't done it together since having kids. Anyways, I would say I err on the side of \"normal\" when it comes to gifts for the kids. I think. I typically do 5-6 gifts plus stockings but one gift is always a book and one is usually clothing. My kids are still young enough that their needs are always met and they aren't asking for outrageously expensive things\nHowever, I know our visitors go completely overboard. And my kids are still young but they will certainly notice the difference between them getting 5 gifts and their cousin getting 20. I tried to nicely explain that I would feel bad if my kids had to watch their cousin unwrap triple the amount of gifts and wonder why Santa was so good to her compared to them. So multiple times I have asked for an estimate on how many gifts they planned on giving their daughter and how many Santa would bring and it was just...weird. like they have just dodged the question or are so vague that I can't even get a read on if they're giving 5 gifts or 10 or 20.\n\n  I figure I would rather buy some cheaper gifts like a puzzle or cheap book and wrap them for my kids so that it at least appears equal-ish when it comes to unwrapping gifts...but they won't even tell me a rough estimate! Am I wrong for wanting to make it look \"equal?\" Would this question offend you or is there a reason they are so reluctant to tell me?! WWYD? \n\n"

I went to college and I’m graduating soon with my masters. My husband and I got married this year after 6 years of dating and we waited to live together, so we have been happy to finally live together in our home with our dog. \n\nOne of my best friends got started pretty young on the kids thing. She had her first at 18/19 years old. her second at 20, and is now pregnant with her third at 23. My other best friend who I grew up with and was the MOH in her wedding last year got pregnant soon after her wedding and is expecting her first soon. My other best friend who I also grew up with had her first a couple years ago and just found out she’s pregnant with her second. \n\nI don’t feel completely ready to have kids yet. To me we are so young, and I’m about to get my masters so I haven’t had a real full time job all this time since I’ve been in school. I feel like I need time to get started in my career, pay down debt and get some savings going. I want us to be financially stable. But I have also seen how it has worked out just fine for my friends who didn’t wait to be financially stable before having kids, and they have been motivated to work even harder for their kids and they are already ahead of me as far as owning a home and having careers. I know it’s not a competition but it just goes to show how having kids doesn’t hold you back in the way a lot of people tell you it does. \n\nI’m worried my kid is gonna have no one to play with at this point lol. I have 2 siblings and one of them is really young, and the other is older but doesn’t ever want kids. My husband is an only child. So the idea that my kids will grow up with cousins is a little far fetched. I think the kids they will see the most will be our friends’ kids. \n\nI just don’t know. Waiting probably seems like the best course of action, I don’t think we can go wrong with waiting until we are more financially stable, more mature, and more “in that place.” I’m not really in a rush, but damn since everyone around me is already jumping into parenthood it makes me a little sad that I am missing that opportunity to experience it at the same time as them, and it makes me feel a little left behind from my peers. When we hang out they all talk about their kids, about breastfeeding and birth and daycare and pregnancy etc. And we just nod along with nothing to add… it feels so isolating. "

I have a girl who just turned two. \n\nThe boy is just purely self centered and annoying. He’d be doing his thing always with a screen at hand, at a very VERY loud volume. The parents don’t care and it drives me nuts. Even if I ask him to please turn the volume down he’d say “yeah, yeah” and do nothing. \n\nBut who awakens the devil inside me is the girl.  Selfish, stubborn, loud, violent, derogatory. If my girl wants to watch a video with her in her tablet she’d push her away, but will steal my daughter’s tablet if her mom didn’t bring hers. Would take my daughters’ toys out of her hands if she wanted to play with them. Made a whole scene to her mom when she saw my girl playing a game in my tablet that she didn’t have. \n\nLast Saturday my daughter turn 2 and we had a little celebration at home. My little one couldn’t even open her presents because she was right there taking them out of her hands and playing for 5 seconds a before throwing them away and move on to the next thing. \nAt one point in the party I took my girl to her bedroom to put her down for a nap and she followed me. Turned the bedroom upside down, opened every drawer and every box of toys and refused to leave when I told her we needed to be quiet for my girl to sleep, but she made a scandal because she wanted to stay and play with a rocking horse. \n\nThe cherry on top of the pie was picking decorations from the birthday cake before my daughter was even able to blow the candles. Her dad was right next to her while she was all “but I want it! I wannttttt iiiitttt!!!” and did nothing. \n\nFor the love of me I don’t even know how you let your kid be this way, but it’s not up to me. Not my child. Let it be whatever you want them to be, but when you mess up with my daughter I’m going to turn into the devilest monster… but I can’t do that either because they are my friend’s kids. \n\nSo what should I do? What can I do to handle this frustrating situation? I always talk gently to the kids but the parents sitting right there and doing nothing gives me zero authority. And of course I don’t want my friend to be offended, which kinda makes me feel like an idiot because I’m profoundly offended by how her daughter treats mine and she doesn’t even notice!\n\nWWYD?"

I have many bad memories of her making me kiss her on the cheek and lips and it makes me feel so so gross because I didn’t feel like I had a choice when I was little (and I didn’t want to). She also used to tickle and bite me a lot, she literally chased me around the house and did this to me on her bed and I screamed for my brother to help me get away but my mom took it all as a big joke and didn’t stop until I was old enough to physically stop her. She is a school superintendent (for little kids) so I always figured she was right to do this to me (obviously she wasn’t). \n\nAs LO gets older I’ve stated noticing more concerning things she does. She seems to be getting more confident about her actions. Yesterday she was sitting with my baby and she kissed him on the top of his head. I was shocked and immediately said something like ‘you cannot kiss LO, you just kissed him’ and she said ‘no I didn’t’ and acted all surprised. She also started to poke and tickle him and when I told her to stop, she asked why, I explained (bc even though he’s a baby he probably does not enjoy that; he just can’t control his arms enough to swat her away) and she rolled her eyes and disagreed but she did stop. \n\nHow seriously should I take all of this? Am I just being an overly cautious FTM? She’s also made comments in front of me about biting his legs, and when I told her she can never do that she told my infant son that mommy needs to leave him alone with grandma for a while. \n\nI’m huge on consent and always ask my son if I may kiss him on the belly or cheek before I do. I say the same thing ‘May I give you a kiss?’ and he knows what it means and usually smiles big and giggles, and if he ever doesn’t enthusiastically smile when I ask, I don’t kiss him. Some people laugh at me but I believe babies really can communicate this way. \n\nUp until these comments and kiss, she was our only trusted babysitter. But now I don’t want to leave LO alone with her anymore. Am I overreacting? Is a kiss on the head no big deal if LO Is already 4 months old/is this it’s normal grandma behavior?\n\nETA She is amazing with LO otherwise, he smiles bigger when he sees her than when he sees me. He’s obsessed with her. These physical oversteps just started within the last week (he’s 4 months old) so I don’t know if he understands or cares."

Everyone looked so happy. I haven’t taken a picture of myself with my daughter because my eyes are red and my cheeks are constantly tear stained. I’m always frustrated. I realized I’m not happy. I’m not enjoying the newborn phase and I know it doesn’t get easier. I hate breastfeeding. I hate the crying. I’m so exhausted. I feel horrible and guilty, and know my daughter deserves someone better. Someone who is happy. I don’t know how to change.\n\nEdit: thank you everyone for your responses. I truly appreciate them all, I’ve read every single one. I’m so glad to have a community like this. I know social media is deceiving, and the thing that really got to me was that I couldn’t even muster enough to fake a happy picture (I know plenty of those smiling moms also are struggling, but the irrational part of my brain is making me think it’s just me). \n\nI hate how demanding breastfeeding is at night, during the day I don’t mind the bonding, and we have supplemented with a bottle to help her gain weight when she wasn’t gaining appropriately (she is now though). My pump was delayed with the craziness and comes next early week and I’m hoping to be able to exclusively pump and bottle feed so my husband and I can split nights up and get longer stretches of sleep. \n\nMy husband has been a hero in helping, honestly I’d be so lost without him. He’s taken many feedings with the bottle, changed diapers, tried to soothe her all so I could sleep a little more. He’s put us both down for naps some days, and he checks in on how I’m feeling. He’s made sure I’ve been able to shower daily, and that I always have a good meal. I feel guilty over this too, because I know he has moments where he struggles too and I can’t help him more. \n\nUnfortunately with the quarantine no one is allowed to come over to help since we’ve had to leave to visit the pediatrician after she was born and have no idea if we had been exposed and are asymptomatic ect. The isolation part has also really gotten to me, I can’t introduce her to my parents (and this is their first possibly only grandchild), I can’t get newborn pictures, I can’t take her into town for a walk, she can’t meet my friends, I can’t run to grab coffee, or even take a ‘break’ and grocery shop. I know everyone is sacrificing right now, but it really did start to get to me over the last few days. I miss my parents, and it breaks my heart they haven’t met her and I have no idea when they will."

    "body": "I think this is mainly just a rant to be honest.. \n\nI feel like my boyfriend, the father to our 7 week old is useless and that he would watch me have a complete breakdown as long as it meant he could play FIFA. \n\nI feel like he isn't willing to change his life for his son. He still wants time everyday to play xbox, watch all the sports he likes (which is at least 1 televised thing per day) and still partake in his hobbies. I feel like I'm drowning. He won't do night feeds, I have to do them all, if i leave him with the baby every 5 minutes he has some excuse as to why I need to come get him, weather he needs to smoke, he needs the toilet, he wants a drink anything to get out of it. On top of everything I clean, I cook, I look after the house, all he has to do is hoover and take the bins out. He hasn't hoovered in 2 weeks and the bin is overflowing I do everything else in addition to caring for baby. I pick up his stuff, do his washing and everything he just doesn't care. \n\nI'm so close to leaving him I really am. I'm exhausted and he makes things so much worse. I might tell him tonight I want to break up. \n\nOn top of all that he won't come near me. I will do everything I can to make myself look nice, sort my hair, makeup, nails etc and he won't come near me. My self confidence and self worth has never been lower, I put my body through hell with pregnancy and delivery only to now not be worthy of any intimacy from him. What's the point anymore.\n\nEdit/Update: I'm clearly weaker than I thought, it took me until yesterday to tell him I wasn't happy. He didnt even ask me why just gave me a cold shoulder for a while and carried on as normal. I asked him today if he wanted to talk about what I said and he just said there was nothing to talk about. I'm not even worth trying."

My kid is only a baby, almost toddler, but I also have zero experience with kids before my child, so idk.\n\nThis is a crosspost from eceprofessionals. Most of everyone seems to think it was OK. I'm not sure tbh. Still worried, but also not sure I'm not overreacting. \n\nAs I said in the other post, I'm very patient and I don't yell at anyone. I tell my kid \"no\" plenty, but I'm not someone who loses their temper very often. When I do, I'm usually very calm. So maybe I'm just not used to the idea. \n\nBasically, the kids were playing some game where the one on the back would walk to the front and take the place of the one leading. And they'd keep switching like that. They were pretty small, maybe 2/3 the way up to the door knob of a door. \n\nThe teacher screamed at them to come back in the room and that she was tired of telling them. It was not a situation where she raised her voice, she literally screamed loud enough it still had the volume of yelling past the glass door I was behind (and it's pretty thick). \n\nI was just there waiting for my child. \n\nIs this a red flag or not?"

She wanted me to go to EPS- Emergency Psychiatric Services at the Hospital.  She said she would call the police to make me go if I didn’t go willingly. So I said I would go (intending to just go home). \n\nMy mom decided to jump on this [opportunity] to get me to go and said she would bring my sick 6 month old into the hospital with all the other sick people if I didn’t go in and willingly commit myself. So I went in. \n\nI was there Monday evening from 6pm to 10:30pm. They (the hospital) took all my stuff away and gave me scrubs to wear and kept me in this holding area until they could evaluate me. They assured me that I would be evaluated that day but I wasn’t sure. I didn’t know if that was true or even if I would be able to leave. I thought I was going to lose my job and our families medical insurance, I didn’t know if I could contact my husband.

She wasted my time, stressed my family out, manipulated me, we’re going to get this lovely medical bill soon and threatened my job all so she could feel better and tried to get me help. \n\nHere’s the thing, I already see a therapist once a week.

I feel like I have been surrounded by the most beautiful, confident, thong wearing, well off, women all week.  \n\nEven as a fit teen I never felt confident in a swim suit. Only once since having children did I wear an actual bikini to the beach, without a tank top to hide behind; to which my 7 year old said \"mom... Are you allowed to be wearing that?\".  \n\nI've put in more effort in the last year, as I near 35, to make heathier choices. I'm not overweight in terms of numbers, but I wanted to eat better, DRINK MORE WATER, and actually try to work out regularly. I haven't lost any weight, but I do feel more toned, and have higher energy.  \n\nStill, I can not feel confident in a more revealing swim suit than the same tankini I've been wearing for 10 years. I am jealous of the confidence of the women around me, especially of the women who have a little (or a lot) of junk in the trunk and can feel comfortable in their gorgeous bikinis. You ladies inspire me!.  \n\nSo tonight, our kids had a \"kids only\" event and my husband and I went out for a date. For the first time ever, I wore high waisted floral bottoms and a cropped top tank top, allowing for about 2 inches of my midsection to show. It might not sound like much, but it was a big leap for me. I did not feel confident. I held my jacket in front, and folded it in my lap during dinner; constantly checking my waistband to make sure no rolls were oozing over the top.  \n\nAfter our meal, a female server from the restaurant came over to me and said \"I'm sorry to interrupt, but are you a physical trainer? I have passed several times and I just had to ask.\" I said \"uhh, no, I'm not. I teach preschool.\" In her beautiful Bahamian accent she said \"No way, Mama! You got your body TOGETHER! On point!\" \n\nI thanked her, downed my wine, then walked to go pick up my kids in a much better mood than when I had dropped them off.  \n\nLift each other up ladies, we all need it."

We have lunch together, after baby's swim class sometimes. \n\nI think we hang out too much, even though I enjoy his company, and sometimes it is stressful for me.

    "body": "She and I used to be really close. Since having kids it feels like I've lost someone. We have completely different parenting styles and I help but think her's is detrimental. Not detrimental. I dunno what the word is. She's not actively hurting or neglecting her child. She is a 'good' mother. She has a lot on her plate. Is she doing her best? I guess. \n\nI can't quite put my finger on what it is that runs me the wrong way about her style. So here's an example from the last time we hung out. \n\nOver snacks, which I brought to share, I have a 2 year old and a 4 year that are both voracious right now so I almost always have some kind of snack on me. Pretzels and popcorn today. She tells her baby who is going hard on that popcorn.. \"No more popcorn.\" I say. \"I have more at home if she wants, I really don't mind.\" She closes the box and pushes it away from her 2 year old. \"Popcorn is gone.\" My daughter opens the box and starts eating. I don't stop her. Her 2 year old starts to fuss seeing that there is obviously more. \"I said no!\" Begin a totally expected tantrum. Her daughter starts thrashing. My cousin's gets clocked in the jaw by her daughters head. She calls her a brat.\n\nIn my mind. This whole thing was completely avoidable. \n\nAt this point all our kids really need naps. They've been busy all day at the park running and playing and now they're getting a moment of quiet before we leave and take them home for naps.\n\nTO ME: this isn't the hill we die on. It's pre Naptime snack. As long as it isn't candy... Who cares? But whatever I don't say anything. \n\nHere's another example. Her 2 year old struggles with gross motor play. She needs help climbing. This is what my cousin says. While I'm watching her for an afternoon so her mom can have a break, her and my kids are playing on a climber that is admittedly for older children. Her toddler turns around and just asks to be 'up' instead of even trying herself. So I teach her how. I support each foot as I show her how to use her hands and feet to climb. \"Hand. Hand. Foot. Foot.\" I say as I show her exactly what to do. At the top I support her butt as she climbs over and slides down. The look of pride and joy on her face at the bottom of the slide is just heart melting.  Later that day I'm talking with her mom of course she wants her mommy's attention. So she tugs on her mom and pulls her over to the climber and says. \"Up!\" My cousin just does it. So the second time the baby does it, I say, \"Hey little one, remember we can do this like a big girl?\" And I do the same thing. Support her body and feet, giving her instructions on what to do with her hands and feet. Mostly I'm teaching my cousin how to do this. Trying to unobtrusively say that YOU have to teach them to be independent. They won't just do it themselves. (Maybe some will...God help you if you try to help my youngest... But her kid is one of those that would rather be helped.) The next time her baby approaches the slide, she helplessly looks back and says, 'up' and her mom just jumps right in and does it for her... \n\nI say nothing. But make a mental note not to bother in the future. \n\nShe has other habits that I can't stand now. She refers to her daughter as a brat when she acts like a very normal toddler (throwing her paci or not wanting to help clean up.) She makes comments about the condition of my kids' toys. Many are second hand or generationally passed down. She has plenty of disparaging comment about my parents (something I used to commiserate about before I had kids, but I've learned to appreciate the help I have instead of wishing for it to be something else.) When she's in my house, which used to be my late grandmother's, she always asks about whether or not I've fixed this or that or when I'm going to move or renovate. She complains about her job. She complains about daycare. She complains about having no one to help her (her parents are deceased and her in laws live out of state.)  It's a never ending spew of griping. I can't hardly be around her anymore. I used to look forward to seeing her. Now that she's a mom... I just... Honestly I'd rather take her kid and just tell her to go. I don't have anything in common with her and I can't help but feel that her daughter will grow up to be...mean. I know for a fact the minute she leaves my house she complains about my kids (especially my super overactive and very exuberant 4 year old), or me or my house or all of the above.\n\nIt feels like I grew up. And she still hasn't. \n\nTLDR: how do you mom's deal with a complete difference of parenting styles? Do you hard ignore? I don't feel it's my place to tell her what to do. Not that she would listen anyways. But I also don't really want to spend time with her anymore. If I do that I fell like her daughter is the only one who loses..."

I'm tired and exhausted all the time. My Marriage and other relationships have suffered and I've needed a break in the absolute worst way. About a month ago the baby started to drop his am nap and take a longer afternoon snooze. It's been glorious ✨️ 🙌.  There is hope, a light at the end of the tunnel if you will. Some days I get a bunch of stuff done while they're sleeping but on the others I happily go and take a nap myself. Props to people who do this for several years, you are all champions and I see you!

    "body": "Hi! I’m 10 months postpartum, 3rd baby, I had zero drive but we started again at 6 weeks pp And have had sex at least once a week since, sometimes 2-3. It took me a longer time for my pelvic floor to heal this time. I was in a lot of pain so I didn’t want to do it any more than that. My husband lost his mind, he was so sexually frustrated. He wasn’t being helpful or bonding with baby but he had a ton of energy to pour into his phone games and telling me that all he wants in life is to be more intimate with me more often and how lonely he was and how he wanted to have regular sex. I explain that he always looks and says he’s sooo tired after work that I don’t ever initiate and he said he’s never too tired for that. We already have sex on his days off. So now at 10 months postpartum my cycle is back and I’m feeling more like myself and he’s been helping way more so I set out to try to fix this situation. I started making it fun and doing the things he’s asked to spice it up. I also know he got himself use to getting off every night to be able to sleep and I’m not ok with porn which I know he’s watching, he’s said he wants me instead. Except now when I get turned down after work because he’s too tired but then goes and watches porn, I feel rejected. I know I’m hormonal but I hate it. I’m putting effort in and doing what he begged for and he seems annoyed I want sex daily. He made a comment about me being out of control. It’s only once a day and he’s getting off that once a day with or without me so I’m really surprised he isn’t happy. "

He wasn’t planned but we went through with the pregnancy and are now blessed with a sweet 4 mo boy!\n\nI was pretty sedentary when i was a teen. Hated all forms of exercise except for swimming, but due to school, i rarely had time to go to the public pool. I was very depressed as well and barely took care of myself. I drank, vaped and smoked cigarettes heavily through 17-19 years old. I didnt eat well either and was consistently severely underweight all my life. before getting pregnant my weight fluctuated between 83-88lbs (37-40kg).\n\nMy lifestyle changed when i met my husband when i was halfway through 19. He’s the total opposite of me, goes to the gym often, and is a martial arts coach. On top of that he was a firefighter when serving his mandatory national service. He took me to the gym once as I was curious about it and I realized i liked it, so I signed on with the gym with him and his best friend being my trainers.\n\nLast year in may we unexpectedly got pregnant and I was hit with HG. Couldnt attend my internship for a month because i was unable to get out of bed at all, but the HG disappeared at 16 weeks so i started eating everything i saw lol. I was constantly snacking and eating meals.\n\nthe HG meant that i couldnt gym as well so i froze my gym membership. after the HG went away, i had to focus my time on my internship (mon-sat, 8am-8pm) so i had no time to gym as well.\n\nAt the end of my pregnancy, i was only 99 lbs (45kg) and my baby was measuring small for gestational age so they pushed for an induction. the delivery was smooth and successful although i had to switch induction methods as both baby and I didnt react well to the first pill they gave me.\n\nin my culture we have a one month confinement period for new moms. So no showers (i still showered once a week), no letting the wind blow directly at me and eating heaty food to replenish the nutrients lost during delivery (something along those lines). \n\nduring my confinement my weight dropped to 94lbs (43kg) and now i weigh 77lbs (35kg). LO was born at 38 weeks, weighing 5.2 lbs (2.4kg). at first it was so easy to hold him but now that he’s 15lbs (7kg), i cant hold him for long periods of time before my arms start getting sore. :( LO is EBF as well.\n\nEveryone (me, husband, ILs, parents) has been trying to help me gain weight but to no avail. MIL cooks everyday and i eat lots everyday but i just cant seem to gain weight. So frustrated. \n\nHas anyone gone through this and have some tips on how to gain weight after pregnancy?"

They’re generally nice people, but lately my MIL has gotten a bit too ‘comfortable’ with me and it makes me dread seeing her. Some recent examples, she told me (3 times) that I should have her and/or my mom in the delivery room bc it’s too much pressure for my husband to be there alone with me and sent my husband and I a video of a man fainting in an l&d room saying she sure hopes that doesn’t happen to us (how is that helpful?); yesterday during dinner at my house with my husband and FIL she asked me how I made the meatballs that I meal-prepped and I told her (it was a family recipe), then she laughed and said ‘oh I will teach you how you’re really supposed to make them’ and told me all about it; when she saw the changing table setup (standard changing mat on dresser) she said it doesn’t make sense for the changing mat to be perpendicular to us while we change him; and lastly when we were telling her that we’re going to to try to not let our baby watch tv before 18 months she told us we should let him watch educational cartoons and that we ‘can’t know everything’ (this is obvious but the tv recommendation is from doctors). \n\nYesterday (while I’m 39 weeks pregnant) they ask to visit us and I say yes. My husband really likes seeing them and it’s been 3 weeks. But then they decide they’ll come over at 12 and stay til 8pm, and occupy themselves while my husband and I go to our infant CPR class. We invited them to the class (their baby safety knowledge is VERY outdated) and they said no bc it’s ‘boring’. They also no-showed at a grandparent class they agreed to take last week. Yet they expect to babysit often (not happening). While we were out, MIL cleaned up from lunch, cleaned my oven, and FIL made dinner. They do nice things for us, it’s not all bad, which is why I’m conflicted. I felt weird about the oven bc she’s asked how she can help before and I don’t ask for anything. It makes me feel judged for having a dirty home when she just cleans stuff randomly. \n\nSo today I wake up with a headache, which happens literally every day-after we see them. I’m exhausted from hosting them, my day was wasted cleaning and entertaining them, and I feel super run down. I don’t know how I can do this with a baby. Does anyone have tips on how to make in-law interactions better? After our baby is born they will want to visit more, and give more ‘advice’. Is this something I just need to suck up and deal with?"

I want another baby, but I also have a feeling it'd just be easier to have only one. Can you address my thoughts and let me know how true or how unfounded my worries are?\n\nThe biggest concern I have is that there will be no peace. With only one kid, I feel like there's a good amount of peacefulness in the house. While my toddler is sleeping, there's peace, but also while I'm doing activities with my toddler. For example, going outside and using chalk. It's pretty easy and peaceful being able to just focus on one kid and I can enjoy the activity fairly easily. If I had two kids, would there be any peace? I imagine their naps wouldn't line up for a long time, if ever, and if I go out with two kids, will I ever be able to relax and enjoy it? Or will I constantly be struggling trying to monitor the two kids?\n\nSomething I've seen a few moms mention online is that once they had a second kid, it was next to impossible to have a clean-ish house. I am not at all a neat freak, but cleaning the dishes and putting the toys away enough so that we're not walking all over them everywhere we step is pretty easy to accomplish right now. Will it really become that hard to do a minimal amount of tidying up once I have two kids? Right now it takes *maybe* five minutes to tidy up our living room.\n\nHow do you make sure your older kid can sleep when your new baby is really little? I'm pretty sure there's nowhere in the house we could go and not hear a newborn baby's crying. Those cries are pretty loud. I feel like it'd be so much harder handling a newborn if my toddler is also super sleep deprived. Will toddlers sleep through newborns crying? Or will have a constantly cranky, tired toddler until the newborn can sleep through the night?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights."

His mom on the other hand absolutely loses it when we miss a holiday there and guilts us and plays the “poor me” game. Side note: Our families live 30 minutes apart from each other and 4 hours away from us. We live in Canada and this time of year can be -40°C with icy road conditions. \n\n- The first year, we spent Christmas Day at his parents house then went to my parents for a day. \n\n- The second year (last year) we had his parents here (after they moaned and groaned abojt the travel but don’t have kids and are retired….and we do it every year)\n\n- This year, my husband wants to do the 24-26 inclusive at his parents and the 27/28 at my parents. \n\nI agreed to this with the suggestion that if we do this, next year with a baby we will be staying home. \n\nToday I asked what day he’d like to do “our” Christmas. Where we’d do our traditions and the kid could open his Santa gifts and that. He said he assumed we would do it at his parent’s. That’s all three years we would have spent Xmas day with his parents instead of our own family. Kids only get 18 Christmases with their parents and parents only get 18 with their kids (if you’re lucky enough). That’s 3/18 Christmases we haven’t had our “own” Christmas already. \n\nAm I just being hormonal and emotional, or is this an actual issue I should be upset about? I honestly just want to make our own traditions and wonder what it would’ve been like to instead travel 4 hours every Christmas morning and open my gifts with my grandparents whom I only seen three times a year otherwise, instead of waking up to Santa having come and getting to relax at home and play with some of my gifts and relax with my family.

    "body": "(Throwaway because this gets veeeeeeeery TMI)\n\n\n\nToday, I took my son to the pediatrician for his yearly check-up today (his birthday was last week). His regular pediatrician is out on maternity leave, so we had to see someone else for his exam. My son said it was okay for me to stay for the exam so I saw the whole thing.\n\nAt the end of the exam, she asked him if he remembers to pull his foreskin back whenever he pees and to wash under it every day (she must have seen from his chart that he hadn't been circumcised). He asked her what she meant (uh-oh) and she told him that's not good and that she needed him to take his boxers off so she could make sure that he didn't have any problems with his foreskin.\n\nWhen he dropped his shorts, I was honestly surprised at what I saw: his foreskin was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay longer than it should have been. Let's just say he had a two inch banana but a three inch peel. She tried to retract his foreskin but couldn't even pull it back far enough that there was no overhang.\n\nI had always assumed that he grew into his foreskin and it loosened like it was supposed to but I guess he never did. I don't even want to imagine the build-up of smegma and pee he probably has under there. I hadn't seen him naked for a few years leading up to this and his regular pediatrician never did more than pull out waistband on his boxers down a little bit to check for development so I guess she never noticed it either.\n\nThe pediatrician told me that she's never had a patient this old still be unretractable, and even though it isn't a serious problem yet (because he's still prepubescent), she strongly recommends that I have him circumcised.\n\nObviously, I don't want to do that unless I absolutely have to, and I've been looking into alternative options (mainly steroid cream). Does anyone have any experiences with that?\n\nAlso, just so I can get an idea of what's normal (because I live in an area where just about every boy is circumcised), if your son is uncircumcised, how old was he when he could first retract it? Was it before or after he started puberty? And how much overhanging foreskin does he have?"

I’m breastfeeding, so I made sure to have plenty of milk ready in the fridge. I even pumped immediately before I had a drink to have fresh milk on hand.\n\nI planned to finish the drinks by a certain time to make sure I could breastfeed our baby one more time before they went to bed. My husband just told me he’s extremely frustrated because the baby cried while I couldn’t nurse because of the alcohol. (Total - about 3 hours.) We gave the baby a few bottles and they still were crying - overall ok, but crying.\n\nHe said, “You should know this, the baby just wants to be close to you at night,” he said. He shamed me for wanting to enjoy a few drinks. As if I don’t know that the baby wants to cluster feed. Also as if I don’t know that this baby is attached to me all day.\n\nI said, “I planned well in advance - we have bottles, I know I’ll be ready to feed them right before they go down for bed.” Apparently that wasn’t a good enough answer for him. And now I’m getting this passive aggressive cold shoulder treatment. He’s storming through the house doing “chores” like folding laundry, but he won’t look me in the eye and he’s got this angry air about him as he storms through the room.\n\nAm I wrong to be pissed off and frustrated at him for his answer and demeanor? I planned in advance by pumping milk for our baby, I made sure to finish my drink at a certain time so I could feed the baby a few hours later at their bed time… what else could I have done?? Yes, a 5 week old wants to cluster feed and be cuddling on me sometimes. But gees, I planned as well as I could have. I feel like this is gaslighting and he’s just shaming me.

I’m wondering if you guys can give me a list of breast feeding essentials and pumps you would recommend? I’m in Canada so pumps are more limited here, but I’m really leaning towards the madela freestyle as it seems to be very portable and discreet. Also if you wouldn’t mind including an essential care list for myself? I gather it can become quite painful. \n\nI am also looking for any sort of insight on what to expect and what I should prepare myself for. Tips and tricks too?\n\nI’d also like to add I have purchased a bottle sterilizer/dryer aswell as a bottle warmer and starter bottle kit and would like to have my partner do some feedings but I have read that they can get nipple confusion? Will using bottles hinder the process at all and should I wait until she’s got feeding from my nipples down pat? Also pacifiers should I avoid those too?

I just need to vent and no one gets it. Everyone thinks I should just be happy to provide well for my baby.\n\nnow for the venting!. I Have an over supply issue... Like Way over supply this is my second kid , and the second time I have chosen to 100% breast pump. First kid didn't know how to root, latch or suck , second kid had a bad latch and bit me so badly. So I resorted to pumping because it worked well with the first.. \n\nWith first kid I peeked out at 90 oz / day spread across 5 pumpings .... And no even at 5 pumpings I didn't have trouble with keeping supply up around 90. But that is 9 oz / side per pumping session.... This time I wanted to start decreasing and I have been spreading the pumpings out but the supply isn't going down ... I'm only pumping 3 times a day 5:30, 1:30, 9:30 and I'm going to exploded. ( I have tried most of the weaning tricks and even some of the Whoo-Whoo advice I can find )\n\nthis morning I pulled down 34oz.... that is more than I need to feed my son for an entire day . My boobs feel like Hot water balloons not to mention the weight... a 36K weighs approx 5lb / boob . the milk is adding or removing a whole pound per side. Its messing with my balance. \n\nLets not even mention how difficult it is to stay hydrated... if your taking out 100oz / day then you have to put that in ... I have to drink 200oz / day just to not get a head ache. that is 12 oz / hr every hour I'm awake I'm so sick of the taste of water! I'm currently paying for carbonated water with flavoring added to change it up. \n\nMy boobs are actively changing multiple cup sizes in one day . they are a 36 K when not filled with milk... I feel like my boobs precede me into any room and they are half my depth and I also feel like they are the only thing people see as they visually change size during the work day. \n\nmy son is almost 4 months old and a saint... but why the oversupply. I know that undersupply can be difficult to deal with but I needed to vent, oversupply can be just as painful and difficult to deal with as well. \n\n"

She also throws aunts/uncles/nieces/nephews birthday dinners (sometimes they are unwanted) and hilariously complains about the amount of work it is. \n\nGrowing up, for me, birthdays were normally spent with my parents and siblings.

    "body": "As many of you can imagine, I am at my wits end. My healthy baby boy just does not sleep. He’s king of the cat naps. He’s two months. He’ll take 15-20 minute naps 2-3 times a day and that’s enough I guess???? Then at night we can usually get one decent 2-3 hr block out of him and then the second half of the night is a very fit full sleep where he’s kind of up and down the whole time. Now we’ve struggled with reflux but we’re using a formula now that has helped a decent amount. And we know what it looks and sounds like if reflux is getting him up and it’s not that very often anymore. Plus that I can understand. It seems like he’ll have one day every 3-4 days where he sleeps like what I imagined babies sleep like- 3 nice long (2-3 hr) naps and then 2 decent blocks at night with two wake ups for food. Then the rest of the days are all cat naps and very little deep sleeps. We’re sleep deprived but mostly just at a loss for what the hell to do. He’s thriving, gaining weight, super healthy appetite. Besides the reflux, which is semi under control now, there’s no obvious concern. We’ve got every sleep option you can imagine- swing, vibrating seat, bouncing seat, inclined sleeper, flat bassinet, co sleeper... we’ve swaddled and unswaddled. Lights out or dim lights, soothing music or silence, white noise and sleepy lights projected onto ceiling. Baths before bed, lavender bath and sheet spray. I’m a FTM and admittedly clueless, but come onnnnn. I’m going back to work very soon and I’m panicked I’m going to be a mess from the sleepless nights. Everyone keeps saying ‘oh the first 3 months are brutal and then it gets better blah blah.’ But I feel skeptical. And what the hell am I supposed to do until then? And what if the promised relief doesn’t come? Do people survive this?! \n\nHELP ME MAKE THIS BABY SLEEP PLEASE!!!!! \n\nAddition- my mom seems to think that the baby is not satisfied by this ‘thin’ formula we are using. It seems like we feed him hourly. We always looks at each other and say ‘he cannot be hungry again!’ And he latches onto the nipple like we’ve been starving him for weeks. I’ve even started using premie nipples to slow down his guzzle. She suggested rice cereal in the bottle but the Internet has some horrible things to say about doing this. He’s only 2 months and I’m worried it’s way too soon to introduce rice cereal. There’s also reflux/spit up prethickened formulas- anyone have thoughts on these? \n\nThanks "

    "body": "Rant incoming\n\nThis past week I (29F) have been sick with a fever, chills, body aches, a terrible sinus headache/migraine and cough. My husband (30M) works 12 hour days and weekends, so I have been home with our 2yo and our 4mo. All this past week despite being sick, as the stay at home parent I’ve had to power through and take care of our kids, cooking meals and making snack boxes so my husband has food to take to work for his long days, giving my kids baths, doing the bedtime routines, the grocery shopping, the laundry, the dishes, the overnight wakings and feedings with our 4mo. Then a few days ago our 2yo came down with a fever so I was waking up with her overnight too. Finally the weekend came and my husband promised it would be my turn to rest since I hadn’t had a chance all week, and he knew I was still sick and exhausted. Well, naturally he comes down with food poisoning or some type of stomach/gastrointestinal bug and is having diarrhea and vomiting all night. \n\nSo I continue waking with our infant overnight into the morning and then my husband took over from about 8-10:30. During that time he got both kids up, dressed, fed our toddler breakfast, fed our infant, fed our 2 dogs, let the dogs out and that was it. I wake up to the sounds of him yelling at our toddler to stop fighting him during a diaper change, and him calling me saying he needs wipes because she had a blowout and he doesn’t have wipes. I bring down a pack of wipes and discover our toddler’s blowout left poop on our infant’s sit up chair which is hand wash only because it doesn’t come apart, and our infant has had a blowout as well in his mamaroo which my husband didn’t notice. I ask him if he has checked our toddler’s temp because she has been running 100-102° temperatures and he admits that no, he hasn’t but he has checked his and he doesn’t have a temp of his own. Which good for you but I’m more worried about our child who can’t advocate to get medicine on her own if she’s not feeling well…\n\nMy husband then falls asleep on the couch after the diaper change, and I’m left to hand wash the sit-up chair, and handle the baby’s blowout and clean the mamaroo insert. While my husband is napping, I empty the dishwasher, bring down and wash all the bottles from overnight, check our toddler’s temperature, reload the dishwasher, check the baby’s temperature to make sure he’s not getting sick, take my own medicine, and get our infant’s laundry started. Maybe I’m just looking for a bone to pick but I’m just feeling so frustrated because it feels like I’ve had to power through this whole last week being under the weather, having no choice because our kids need me, but he’s home now and he’s here and capable and I get that he doesn’t feel good became same, but he can’t pick himself up just a little bit and show up even a little bit? Like am I asking or expecting too much? Am I being unreasonable or unfair? \n\nTL;DR \nI was sick this whole past week but because husband works 12 hour days, I had to take care of our 2yo and 4mo by myself while sick. My husband promised when the weekend came, I’d be able to rest and he’d watch the kids. Naturally Friday night he comes down with food poisoning or a gastro bug and ends up having diarrhea/vomiting all night and has spent all but 2 hours napping. I’m frustrated because what was supposed to be my turn to rest is just more of my time spent taking care of the kids while sick and exhausted. Am I being unreasonable or unrealistic in expecting and wishing that my husband power through his illness like I do mine, to parent our kids?"

    "body": "I don’t know just feeling a need to vent because I had a moment where I kinda froze and felt extreme anxiety and pain in my chest.\n\nI’m a FTM with a 7 week old, who I exclusively breastfeed, because bottles are for wussies (🙄)\nOfc I have completely fallen in love and I’m really excited for this new life experience.\n\nI feel like I’m going the motions as any other first time parent (in general) with the late nights and ppd, but I always push through for my baby and never mind the frustrating moments for her happiness.\n\nNow, before I get too off track about how much I adore my baby lol I really just wanted to rant about this impending doom I’m feeling when I have to go back to work.\n\nI pretty much just left my job high and dry after I felt like I had enough and just wanted to finally take a moment and relax leading up to the day I’d finally give birth, not even bothering to complete my leave of absence. I worked my entire pregnancy and by the end I was just overwhelmed and didn’t want to be bothered.\n\nWell now that I did get all that situated, I just received my maternity back pay and currently on bonding, it’s got me thinking about when I’m due to go back to work. I’m stressing thinking about the stress I know I’m going to have because once I go back to work that’s hours I’d be away from my baby. I’m not mentally prepared for that. \n\nMy maternity only covered 4 weeks of pay and bonding pretty much covers none. It’s just time I can take off whenever I need to for my baby. Instead I’ve chosen to take it all at once and don’t plan on going back until April because I’m not ready to be away from her so soon. I don’t care whether it’s paid or not.\n\nThen on top of that, I worry about the things that probably won’t but COULD happen while I’m away. I’m lucky to have my mom around still but I know my mother. She’s impatient and cuts corners, it’s just one of those situations where I’d hate to risk anything cause I know things won’t be done how I’d like.\n\nI refuse to even consider daycare and I feel like that needs no explanation. I don’t have many other options with babysitting as I don’t fully trust my 18yo sister to watch her even..\nI asked her to watch my baby while I needed to walk away to do something, baby was on the crying and thrashing about, she literally just stood there and watched the baby 🫤…\n\nI don’t see how some parents do this. My aunt said I won’t be able to protect her from everything but I swear if I can help it. I just want her to be okay and happy. I don’t want anyone to mistreat her and see her cry."

    "body": "Sorry if this is long, this is a bit of a rant.\n\nI have been dealing with \"mom rage\" after my second baby (who turns 1 today!). He is the sweetest little boy, and a decent sleeper, but for some reason once in awhile when he wakes through the night I get this horrible rage and am seething mad. This is not like me at all, and I was so embarrassed. My husband, instead of helping with the baby, would just say \"what is wrong with you?\".\n\nI decided to join this parenting mental health support group, and last week we were talking about emotions. They said that instead of being embarrassed or suppressing our emotions we should get curious about them and try to find out our triggers. They said you usually aren't reacting to whatever set you off, rather it is a culmination of things and that was just the straw that broke the camera back, so to speak. \n\nSo, last night the baby woke up and he wouldn't go back to sleep and I was getting so rage filled. Except this time I got curious. And I had an epiphany. The only time I get this mad is when my husband is home (he works shift work and is gone a lot of nights) but he is not helping, and I am handling the night waking by myself. \n\nI am so tired of being a married single mom. He was gone on an overnight trip with some friends last weekend, and it was great! The house was cleaner, I felt more organized, I managed meals and extracurriculars and at the end of every day I went to bed with a clean house, and I wasn't the slightest bit mad when the baby woke up. He asked if I missed him and I said no, I didn't. When he is here I feel lime I am managing 3 kids, except one is a grown-ass adult. It should be easier with two parents, but it isn't. He is so lazy and will try anything to avoid parenting. I am always nagging him to get off his phone and to not just throw on the TV for the kids (my other child is 3). He barely cooks, just the 1 meal a week I make him do. If he is alone with the kids around lunch he \"forgets\" to give them lunch unless I remind him. I handle all the default parent stuff. He does clean a bit, but half-assed (will vacuum the floor but doesn't put anything away first, will just pile it on the table, for example).\n\nThe funny thing is that before kids he wasn't like this. He would clean and cook. We had conversations before we moved in together about the division of labor and he said all the right things. I know I shouldn't let things be this way, but I am so sick of fighting all the time  I am sick of nagging him. It shouldn't be this hard. \n\nI don't want my kids to have divorced parents, but I really don't want them to grow up in this kind of household and think it is normal. I am just coming off mat leave and truly can't afford to leave right now, so I think I am going to sit him down again and tell him what I have said here, and ask for couples therapy. One last chance. Things will either work out, or else that will give me some time to get some money together. I am so tired of being this angry, bitter mom. I truly thought the problem was me, but now I can see clearly that it is my relationship.\n\nI'm not sure why I am posting this, I just needed to get it out. "

She refused to sleep or eat and her bottle refusal has followed her home. She won't even take a bottle from my husband even though she did every day for the last 3 months. \n\nMy boss has been so supportive and has allowed me to work a part time schedule while I try to get her transitioned but her separation anxiety just keeps getting worse. My mother in law came to help this week and I've been leaving the baby home with her instead since she is a familiar face...this hasn't worked as I thought and even me just handing her over to my MIL results in screaming for hours. \n\nThe separation anxiety is also affecting her sleep which affects my sleep. She's waking for hours at night and I cannot get her back to sleep. I am exhausted and even 4 hour shifts are hard for me right now. \n\nWe found a nanny that can watch her full time, but if she's this way with my mother in law, how will she be with a total stranger? I don't know how much longer I can do this. Being away from her for 9+ hours a day is starting to seem impossible. \n\nI feel so defeated 😞 "

I think it'll be clear why.\n\nI have three under three (or close enough, my oldest turned 3 a month ago) and I'm at home with them. For the last seven months my husband has been working extra hours and frequently traveling for work, so it's usually just me holding down the fort. I feel like there's always *something* going on, or someone needs something RIGHT NOW. And that's at home, if I go out to run errands and bring them along I need to have an eye on all three all the time. Honestly, it can be a little exhausting, but I can handle that well enough. What I can't handle is getting to the bathroom when I'm the master of this three ring circus, especially if we're out and about. There have been a few times where I got caught short and wet my pants as I tried to wrangle all the kiddos so I could bring them into the bathroom with me. Needless to say, that was mortifying. So I grabbed a couple depends left over from the last birth and tried wearing them as backup, and it helped, but they were leak prone and I still had to change them soon after which was also a challenge given the situation. After a bit of searching, I've gotten some full blown adult diapers that can usually last me all day if I need them too, or at least until all three are down for a nap and I can change. And honestly, it's been working great...if you can't get a potty break because you're caring for three kiddos in diapers, join 'em and wear a diaper too. At least that's my take. \n\n\\[Edit: Honestly, as insane as it seems, I actually fully endorse the \"adult diapers as life hack\" strategy for certain situations, and I'll probably use it in the future. I've found that with the right diaper it doesn't bother me. I'm low-key proud of my resourcefulness in finding a solution. But to have to resort to this day in day out tells me my life has lost any semblance of sanity.\\]\n\nBut seriously, what has my life become, that I'm a grown-ass woman wearing adult diapers everyday because I'm spread so thin and can't get to the bathroom when I need to? I love these little ones, but I feel like they've driven me to insanity if this is seriously what is going on with me. Send chocolate and bourbon..."

    "body": "\nSo, I just got this sentence this morning. I'm 8 months pregnant, run a business from home, and care for our toddler daughter. My husband has had a bad streak at work for over 2 years now, so he's at work 6 days a week 8am-8pm, I've been carrying all household duties, 99% of childcare, because when he's home he's tired, and growing my company. It's a lot, especially now that I'm pregnant. His problem at work is literally time management. He can't manage to get his tasks done within the time frame, but is not paid for overtime...\n\n\nBefore I got pregnant things were looking up and we've always wanted more kids with short gasps. My husband swore up and down that he'll be home more, that things were really finally going well... well the 1st trimester it all went to shite again. My morning sickness is \"evening sickness\". He'd get home to me hugging a bucket with our 2yo jumping on me.\n\n\n2nd trimester he started trying for a promotion, which would help us a lot, but it requires him to finish a few big projects = more time at work... alright, I will manage. During that time I've been sick multiple times, but I keep working through it because we have no alternative/my husband will not take time off. Let me tell you, having a sinus infection that you can't take almost any meds for, while chasing a toddler, while pregnant is a special kind of hell. It takes a lot of mental strength not to complain.\n\n\nI'm in the 3rd trimester now. I've asked that I'd love to have a bit of time together since there will be no time once baby is here. We've been on literally two dates last year... well Valentines day he was working all day and sick in the evening... promised to make up for it, but I don't think he will. I'd be OK, but he git our daughter really excited too and she still brings it up.\n\n\nThen it was my birthday... you can guess how that went. Exactly the same. And I didn't complain, at all, I cooked us a dinner and did everything. He's promised to take me out later but again... I don't see it happening. I asked to watch a movie at home... I don't see it happening. \n\n\nOur daughter is sick, I can feel myself catching it. Again, I'm fine, I will handle this. I do all the night wake-ups, I'm up with her in the morning, I do all the day activities, while managing work. I get one evening a week where he does the nught-time routine so I can stay sane. Once a week I get to sleep in, usually, that hasn't happened in weeks now.\n\n\nIt took me an hour to get him out of bed today. As it often does when he's stressed. Before he left I asked him if my \"sanity evening\" is a go today, because I'm honestly exhausted. He looked at me and said the title. \"All you do is try to sabotage me. I've spent months telling you how serious it is with my work and you just don't get it. You want all the things to just be how you want them. My eyes filled up and I just left the room. Now I'm writing this while my daughter eats her snack, I got a raging headache from the cold and trying not to cry. \n\n\nCherry on top? I have a low BP and last pregnancy I ended up hospitalised at 8 months in because I kept fainting from overworking myself. I'm just trying to not have that happen again, by asking for help when I feel I'm crossing the line...\n\n\nI don't know why he chose me to be the enemy when he's stressed. He used to be my biggest fan, he's supported me starting my business, he loves to \"show me off\" and talk about my successes. How TF have we ended up here?\n\n\nETA: we're trying to start at a daycare, but it's really not an option here untill 3yo. And my husband can't change his job, he has a very niche specialisation, and going into a different profession would mean a serious pay-cut, which we can't afford. The promotion should get him into a different line of the same niche work, a but which is much easier for him to time-manage."

I have tried everything. This isn’t my first kid either, he is actually my 4th and my other 3 weren’t great sleepers but around 4 months I got them to learn to self-soothe a little and they could be laid down in their cribs groggy- but awake and they slept in their cribs with 1-2 wake ups to eat. \n\nMy son will be out cold and will scream bloody murder when you lay him down. I tried laying his crib mattress on the floor in the corner with my mattress (the extra one we put in his nursery) right beside it so I could comfort him easily and quickly and that didn’t work. I bought a weighted sleep sack, made no difference. Doesn’t take the paci. \n\nHe won’t nap either. Even holding him and rocking him for naps, he still screams for a little while until he finally passes out and he will sleep for an hour to an hour and a half (held). I have tried laying him in his crib and just comforting him without picking him up but he screams. I tried rocking him and laying him down, wakes right up. I have spent 45 min to an hour, sometimes more, just trying to get him to nap in his crib the last couple days hoping if I could get him to nap it might translate to better sleep at night. But I spend so much time trying to get him to sleep that he is due for a feeding. So I give in and feed him and he falls asleep at the boob but he is almost 6 months and I am afraid of creating a bad habit of him needing to nurse  to fall asleep and I go back to work in 10 days.\n\nI feel like I’m not enjoying by last baby because I am exhausted and frustrated all the time!"

So basically ever since last Saturday I had been feeling under the weather and my husband has too, but he will just lay around and sleep to get better and me? You guessed it. Still went grocery shopping, cooked, watched over the kids, cleaned etc. Never got to truly rest until bedtime, during which my husband leaves for work and the kids sleep next to me, so my quality of sleep is not great. \n\nFast forward to today, my husband texts me while I’m at work how I’m feeling and I say I still feel shitty, that I just want to lay down and rest when I get home and eat soup. Husband says ok I’ll make soup. This man texts me while I was on the way home saying the canned soup we had is expired so he can’t “make” it. I thought he was literally home cooking soup so I was upset and just ordered some for take out at a local restaurant. I picked it up, came home and he had taken NyQuil so he was literally already dozing off on the bed. I said hey you know, I would like to get rest I said this earlier, can you watch over the kids? He says they’re fine I can rest. Which I know I can literally rest but if I’m sleep and he’s sleeping no one is watching over the kids. So I stay up while he dozes off and I’m so irritated but I stay calm for the kids. He hears that I’m becoming overwhelmed by the demands of the kids (we have 3) and he eventually gets up and takes over. Well this glory lasts for about 30 minutes and it’s super quiet so I go in the living room and he’s sleeping again while the kids are still in school clothes, not bathed, and still just watching the TV. At this point I’m over it and tell him that it’s pointless in him saying I could rest if he’s just gonna ditch responsibilities and rest too. I still had to brush kiddo’s teeth and read nighttime stories, while he still remained sleep. \n\nI feel like I need to run away 😢"

It’s the only C-section post I’ve ever fully related to and loved. \n\n“C-section scar, You are the dark place cut into me that opened into light.” ❤️\n\n\n\nDear C-Section Scar,\n\nI didn’t want you. I didn’t plan for you. In fact, I did everything I could to avoid you. But today I touch you with compassion. I smile at you. I send love, grace, and tenderness to you.\n\nYou are not weakness. You are not failure. You are not a mistake. You are part of me.\n\nYou are not a dead end, the place where my birth journey halted and could travel no further. You are a passage I am still discovering. You are the door that opened to my baby. You are the door that opened into who I am as a mother and as a woman.\n\nRiding over bumps in the car. Laughing and coughing. Bending at my waist. The day I stopped taking narcotics to soften your pain was a milestone. The day I could get out of bed without holding my husband’s arms and without searing pain was a milestone. The day I could stand up from the rocking chair while holding my baby was a milestone. The day I could sit on the floor to play with my son and make my own way back up to my feet was a milestone. The day I could bend over to pull my underwear up by myself was a milestone. These were milestones I resented. I didn’t want to have to be passing through these milestones.\n\nI wasn’t prepared for the numbness. I couldn’t feel anything when my fingertips touched my own skin in the inches between my belly button and pubic bone. My fingers felt like they were touching someone else’s body; there was no feedback from my nerves that had been cut. It felt like I was touching something in me that had died.\n\nThe doctor cut through six layers of muscle, tissue, and organ to get to my baby. She separated my abs in the middle and pulled my baby through. I have met at least seven new layers within myself because of you.\n\nYou are not my whole story of becoming a mother. But I will never know how my birth as a mother would have been different had I pushed my baby out of my vagina.\n\nC-section scar, You are the dark place cut into me that opened into light. You will never be one simple story, but you will always be mine.\n.\nPosted in dedication to all the C-section mamas✨\n\nBy: Catherine Gray @unsilencedwoman"

    "body": "I try not to think about it, but this past week I’ve been back to crying every day about it. \n\nMy daughter spent 10 days in NICU. The last day her doctor told us they were still hearing a murmur and wanted us to take hero to a cardiologist the following day. We had one night of normalcy after the most intense sadness I couldn’t ever describe, wondering if my daughter would even come home, only to find out the next to she had what’s called an AV canal that will require open heart surgery. \n\nAn AV canal is most common in babies with Down syndrome and specifically trisomy 21, so for my baby without it to have this is very unusual as we don’t have family histories of congenital heart defects either. She basically has a hole in the upper and lower chambers of her heart, and the main valve that was supposed to be split in two never split, which leads to other problems.\n\nYou can’t tell by looking at her. She’s growing perfectly and because of that we’ll be able to wait until she’s older for the surgery, but I still hurt so bad knowing it has to happen and am always questioning why. \n\nI feel constantly like I’ve failed her. Like it was something I did to put her in NICU and have her heart not formed properly. I get angry that I went in for 5 anatomy scans, specifically to look at her heart because I was going to be induced a month early, once being days before she was born and they didn’t see the valve. I get angry that something worse could’ve happened during delivery because they missed it.\n\nI get intrusive thoughts of worst case scenarios \n\nwhat if she needs more than one surgery\n\nI get horribly, horribly sad, that my baby is going to have to go through such a gruesome surgery and be left with a scar, and then people make me feel bad for being sad that she’ll have a scar. I know it’ll be normal one day, I know it doesn’t change her, but why can’t I be sad\n\nI know she’s needs it, but that doesn’t mean I have to be *okay* about it. \n\nI feel like it’s my fault she has to go through with this…my fault she might get bullied for her scar because kids are mean….\n\nShe’s beautiful and happy and so strong \n\nBut I’m so sad. I hate this so much."

    "body": "My boyfriend (27m) and I (29f) moved in together awhile ago with my two young children. I moved to his city for a job that pays pretty well. Like well over $5000 a month. I planned to pay off a lot of my debt and get my kids and I a lot of fun stuff we’ve always been wanting. After a few weeks though my boyfriend stopped waking up in Time for work. He claims he just can’t wake up. He has no idea why except he stays up till 2 am playing video games and watching tv every night. No different than before we lived together. After awhile he was making no money cuz he was just skipping work days. We decided he would just quit bc he got into a web dev program that’s supposed to be done in 9 months. I was happy at first because I figured I’d have more time to spend with him. But he won’t wake up. He says he “cant” wake up. If he agrees to take my son to school in the morning I have to set an alarm to wake up myself wake up my son and get him ready and then I have to wake my boyfriend up because “he cant” supposedly even though he had no trouble at all before we moved in together. Meanwhile I have been footing his outrageous bills. I have two kids and my bills are nil. His are over $1000 a month. Which I’m fine with but he stays in bed till I wake him up and I have to repeatedly do so. He watches my kids over the weekend while I work nightshift 6pm to 7am. I don’t get home till 8/830 every morning and I’m exhausted. I come home to an absolute disaster in my home and my young child being up for hours without supervision bc he will not get out of bed. I’ve worked really hard to get where I am and I work tirelessly to keep it nice and tidy in our home but he hardly lifts a finger. When he’s with us, he’s on his phone. He plays with my kids sometimes. But for the most part he’s lost in his phone. I’ve repeatedly asked him to help more around the house bc I’m tired as hell and physically my body is breaking from all the work. But nothing has changed at all. I think that if I work 40+ hours, do all the housework and most of the parenting, then he can do 20 hours of school, an equal amount of housework and parenting but evidently that’s too much to ask of him? According to him he “cleans a lot” but I don’t see it. There’s trash everywhere, unfinished food sitting out, piles of unfolded laundry, dirty floors, full sink no matter how much I do, I feel like I’m just being shit on at every turn. There’s a lot more issues but this is the main one. I have a two year contract at my company and he watches my kids or else I wouldn’t be making as much money. I’m only 6 months in to the job and I want out, I want to go back to being just me and my boys."

Lately, by the time I get the kids to bed, I find myself wondering why on earth I decided to have kids because right now I’m not enjoying this. I’m running on like 3.5 hours of broken sleep every night. The baby is breastfed because the cost of formula is too much and honestly I’ve not enjoyed it since day 1. He’s on my boobs alllllll the time. I’m always covered in breast milk. I hate nursing bras. I can’t just hold him without having to whip out a nipple. \n\nMy toddler waits until I’m pinned down feeding him to ask me to fix a toy or play or whatever. Then she loses her mind when I ask her to wait. I set aside time everyday to focus just on her but she just gets cranky and fussy and I don’t enjoy it. I find myself disengaged more and more. She’s an insanely picky eater and I lose patience. She frequently throws huge tantrums that wake the baby up then I have to start over with the feeding and rocking and shushing and it makes me even more frustrated with her. \n\nMy husband and I are fighting all the time. I feel like I’m walking in egg shells. He’s completely unsympathetic to how hard it is to keep the house the level of tidiness he expects and he claims that the “clutter” stresses him out and triggers his irritation. But it’s not clutter. It’s MY stuff. It’s my books, my clothes, our daughter’s toys, the kids clothes. I have nowhere to keep my books because he filled up the bookshelf. This stupid house has no closets. I have one small dresser that I have to cycle my clothes through based on what fits and is in season because it’s too small to fit all of my clothes which really isn’t much. My daughter has a small dresser but again, it can’t fit much. My son has nowhere to keep his clothes so they are folded up on the floor in the storage room. \n\nI handle 100% of the housework and childcare and he claims it’s because of how difficult and chaotic work is right now, but that’s a recent development and I’ve been handling everything since our daughter was born. I have no friends because I don’t drive. I have no family here. I hate my house. I’m starting to resent my husband. I’m regretting so many life choices. \n\nI love my kids, but I’m tired of being the default parent. Hell, I’m getting tired of being a parent, period. I hate my body and my image. I hate being so lonely. I don’t know what the point of this is since nobody can fix it. Maybe just to get it off my chest. I don’t know."

He doesn’t have any disabilities, he just acts like a small child and doesn’t help. He works from home (as do I, I’m in graduate school but I’m also a TA for an online lab class). The baby woke up at 4am on Friday coughing and sneezing, not able to go back to sleep. I gave her milk, changed her diaper and just did whatever I could to keep her calm and quiet because “Dad can’t function without 9 hours of sleep.” By noon I was exhausted and he was still sleeping. I woke him up to make the baby some lunch because she was stuck to me like glue (she didn’t feel well, I don’t blame her). The conversation went like this:\n\n“I can’t cook in a dirty kitchen.” \n- If it’s dirty clean it or hold the baby so I can clean it. \n “She doesn’t like me that much.”\n- Well I’ll clean it while I hold her so you can cook.\n“Nobody likes what I cook so I’m not doing it.” \n\nSo I get up feeling exhausted and also sick to cook in the ALREADY CLEAN kitchen. I finally get the baby to sleep and she wakes up with a fever. I tell him we need to take her to the hospital and after groaning and asking 21 questions about why she needs to go he gets up and we take her. She had croup and covid. He gets upset at me saying things like “how did she get it?” and “she must’ve gotten it from your mom because she was fine before y’all left” (I stayed with my mom for a weekend last month for my cousin’s birthday). My mom and little brother have both tested negative three days in a row. Both of his sisters and his mom have tested positive but for some reason it couldn’t have been them. \n\nWhen we got home from the hospital, he called me names, said I only ever talked to him when I need help, told me I was “trying to change him” and accused me of cheating. I asked what he meant by trying to change him and he said, “I told you I wasn’t going to do any cooking or cleaning I don’t know why you think anything has changed.” Then he yelled, loud enough for everyone on the street to hear, “Just take your baby in the house so I can get out of here.” \n\nOn the first day of the new year he promised he would help me more with the house and the baby and be more supportive of my emotions and dreams/goals. None of that has happened. \nI have no room in my schedule to cheat on him. I work part time, I’m a full time mom, housecleaner, house chef and grad school is a whole different beast of its own. I get about 4 or 5 hours a sleep per night because I’m up doing all the stuff he refuses to do. \n\nI have a really tight sleeping, eating and activity schedule for both of them because he threw a fit for a week stating that “he never knew what was going on” and “you (me) never know what you want to eat/do”. The activities and meals are planned out weekly and color coded so we’re all on the same page. He says I only schedule things he doesn’t like to do or doesn’t want to eat but every week I ask him what he wants and he says “I don’t know, you’re better at picking all that stuff”. \n\nHe constantly complains about our child not liking him and says I don’t let them spend enough time together but every time I try to take a shower or even go to the mailbox he says she doesn’t like him and just lets her run around screaming until I finish. \n\nHe’s talked bad about me to his friends then complained about me not wanting to be friends with them. He leaves power tools and screwdrivers laying around in the house. He makes messes, doesn’t clean them up and expects me to keep the house spotless while cooking, working, caring for our sick child and scheduling his life. \n\nI’m ready to leave him and I’m in the process of getting my stuff together financially and legally to do it. He’s trying to pretend that everything is normal and I’m just playing along while I get my stuff together because I don’t want him to flip out on me and I don’t want to leave without having a solid plan since my child is so young.\n\nUPDATE: We’re thriving. So glad I made it safely.  : )  I don’t feel like I’m constantly being criticized anymore and I finally feel free to make my dreams a reality. And we’re SO happy."

We pulled him from daycare and haven't sent him back.\n\n\nWithout fail every single time I say I am doing or not doing something because of covid I am told \"well it doesn't really affect children\".\n\n\nMaybe not. But it could affect his mother who I'm sure he does not want to be separated from. And he also could be one of those few babies who DOES end up hospitalized or worse due to covid. Telling me to roll the dice so you can cuddle him after you've been out recklessly exposing yourself without a mask and going to birthday parties or theme parks is inexcusable. \n\nWhen I think about the high risk chances I can't avoid I cry. I can't just take him away from his father and stepbrother and hide out for who knows how long. But if something happens to him I will regret not hiding out every day of my life.

My husband (who really is wonderful in every other aspect) stays up until past midnight, then comes to bed and grumbles on rough nights, then sleeps in as I get up at the ass crack of dawn and try to be perky and engaged with wee one. If you were a fly on the wall in this house, you'd think he was the one up all night with bruised nipples and feeling like a human pacifier. \n\nThis man has only just in the past week started putting our kid down for a nap.

They’re on very expensive— we can barely afford it— urinary stress diet food, our female has had bladder stones removed and they’re both checked out for them every year.

    "body": "My best friend and I have known each other 20 years, and during this time, we have taken care of each other, gone on trips, engaged in creative endeavors together, and allowed ourselves room to grow, but I gave birth three years ago, and this year my husband lost his job. In the time since, things have gotten incredibly tense at home, and I have gone on a heavy medication regimen to deal with my anxiety and bipolar disorder. I have become disengaged from my home life and I have become too involved in my best friend’s life. I have absorbed their problems, and not addressed any of my own. My husband recently got another job, and with 2024 on the horizon, I knew I needed to address this issue with my best friend.\n\nRight after my husband lost his job, I invited my best friend over my house on Wednesday nights for dinner and while it was enjoyable at first, over the course of the last few months, my best friend would come into my house and immediately unload about the work day in front of my toddler, sometimes would have emotional outbursts, and I would take care of them and ignore my daughter. I didn’t realize how much I was doing this, but I did notice that I was beginning to get uncomfortable around my best friend. I couldn’t figure out why I was feeling uncomfortable, or distant, and I just kept talking to them as if nothing was the problem. My best friend had done several things over the course of these last three years that have crossed boundaries, the biggest one being posting pictures of my daughter online (I literally cut my dad out of my life because he couldn’t agree to keep my kid off Facebook), and I never brought it up because I am afraid to. I am having these revelations now, and after speaking with my therapist, she recommended slowly backing away, which isn’t something that will work with my best friend. They’re enmeshed in my life, and I needed to inform them that I had to change my behavior.\n\nDuring a phone call with my best friend on Thursday night, I expressed to them that I had been prioritizing them over my husband and child. To start, I told them that the Wednesday night dinners needed to end because my daughter is going through a sleep regression and having a guest over on the week is really making the process more difficult. Once I said that the conversation got more tense. Eventually, once I said that I need to prioritize my husband and child, my best friend said that “how is that my fault?” Which is not the answer I was expecting. I stuttered and stumbled over my words. I didn’t know how to speak to them. They were crying, I just wanted to let them know that I need to put my daughter first, and in between cries they went “I know obviously, it just hurts.”\n\nI’m angry, quite frankly. I didn’t expect this reaction and I don’t know where to go from here. I’m not saying anything that isn’t a fact. I love my daughter more than my best friend because yeah, of course I do. I gave birth to her. She’s the priority. I haven’t been treating her like one and I need to make the effort now. \n\nDuring the conversation, my anxiety was so high and I didn’t know what to do, so I just said that we’re both in a bad place so it makes sense that this confrontation happened. I told my best friend I just needed space to be with my family and to work to heal together. Like I said, things are rough at home right now and I’ve been ignoring my problems to deal with my best friend.\n\nI received texts everyday since that conversation, and I finally told them today we need to talk in person. What do you recommend I say? What is the brain space of someone who is hurt by the sentence “I need to put my daughter first”? This is my closest friend so to not be allowed the space to focus on my family is just gut wrenching and I just want to simultaneously scream and yell and cry. Why are they acting like this? We went to different colleges and didn’t talk every day and still called each other best friends over a decade ago, so to ask for space now and to not be given it, I don’t know what to do."

She was so excited to go and have the dentist count her teeth, and she did great, even through a cleaning. I was so proud! And then the dentist tells me she has four cavities. Four. One in each of her first molars. The dentist recommended silver diamine fluoride to halt their growth, and I had to hold my once-happy toddler down because it tasted terrible. She screamed that she wanted to go home. I left shaking, and have cried every night since. \n\nI'm still trying to wean her. \"Boo\" is her favorite thing. We've been working on night weaning for a while, and she has a tantrum almost every time she wakes and I tell her she can't have it. I'm interrupting her night routine to brush her teeth after nursing, and she hates the fluoride toothpastes I've tried (I didn't know I was supposed to switch earlier - one of the many things I kick myself for). Tonight I had to hold her down to brush, and she screamed and cried. Her dad laid with her to soothe her, and when I tried to switch back (she sleeps in a crib attached to my side of the bed), she started crying again and said she wanted Daddy. \n\nI'm devastated and angry - at myself, and at my husband, who hasn't done anything to help with her dental hygiene until this week. I feel so stupid for not knowing that breast milk has sugar, for not knowing about the stupid toothpaste, for every time I gave in an gave her a bottle at night - or even *suggested* it over a boob because I was just so tired. Every time I gave her juice or a lollipop or chocolate milk, her favorite things, feels like I should never have let her have them in the first place. She used to love to brush her teeth and now it's an ordeal every time, and I feel like I ruined the dentist for her when it could have been a good experience. Now she doesn't want to go back. How the hell am I going to get her to go for a cavity check up in three months? \n\nI just feel horrible and I don't know what to do. I feel so stupid. I was so focused on how difficult weaning has been for all of us, how hard things have been since I lost my job last year, how much I seem to have on my plate despite having a spouse who fully believes he's pulling his weight, that I too often just went with what was easier instead of what was healthy for her teeth, and here I am, crying and miserable and feeling like the worst mom ever.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for the kinds words and suggestions.

    "body": "So I have a daughter, and I’m really struggling with her behavior. Maybe I’m too uptight or expect too much, but honestly, how she acts and talks to people makes it hard to really connect with her or to be around her. I feel like the worst mother for admitting that. I want to preface this saying she’s pretty mature for her age, and doesn’t really act 7. Her father and I split when she was much younger, and she has always been a daddy’s girl. Her father ended up abandoning her a few years ago. It’s been really difficult. She doesn’t see or talk to him. She’s wildly on the spectrum of “I wish you and dad would get back together, he let me do whatever I wanted” to “I don’t care about him and I don’t want to talk to him.” So there’s obviously a lot of emotions there. She is in therapy, but there’s a pretty long wait where I live. She had an appointment in early February, and her second one is coming up in the next few weeks. Hopefully our visits can be more regular. Anyways, some context, I’ve been with my guy now for quite some time (a few years now) and he’s stepped into the father role greatly. He and my son (4) have absolutely no issues and are thick and thieves. But he and my daughter are constantly butting heads. Before he moved in, I was doing the single mom thing and struggling. I lacked consistency and struggled with routine pretty bad. My anxiety would often flair up, and I would respond pretty angrily and shortly with the kids, especially my daughter. Since he’s moved in, we have a consistent routine, and things are a lot smoother. I don’t feel like I’m drowning anymore. However. My daughter is hard to deal with for sure. She can be so mean. She’s a chronic back talker, she lies, she thinks she always needs to be the center of attention. Her bio dad often fed into this behavior and often ignored our son. However, he’s been gone for years, and I just want to know when it will end. She will often say hateful things to my boyfriend or her brother. We’ve been trying a bunch of different parenting techniques to help curb her general disrespect, but nothing really works. The biggest problem is the constant back talk for sure. If she doesn’t get her way, she creates a crisis. Cries over everything. I try my best to bond with her and be there for her, but her constant attitude is so draining. I find it difficult to engage with her because of the constant stress she’s causing. She also doesn’t seem to learn from any consequences. She gets in trouble for the same things over and over again, and it’s baffling because she’s so smart. For example, let’s say I ask her to pause a game she’s playing (screen time is limited, and I don’t allow YouTube or anything. Just two hours on Wednesday and more lax on the weekends) and ask her to pick up something she left in the floor or something similar. Sometimes she’ll just ignore me. So I’ll ask again a bit more firmly, and she’ll huff, roll her eyes, pause her game with an attitude, maybe mumble something to herself as she’s doing it. It’s eyerolly for sure. It’s just kinda disrespectful in my opinion, because I’m asking her to clean up a mess she knows she should have taken care of before she even played a game. We generally ground her (no Alexa, no screen time of any kind, she’s bound to her room and can read, draw and color) for her actions, and the last time it was particularly bad. My SIL had brought my niece (6) over to play after school, before I had to pick up my BF from work, as we’re a one car family right now. We were just chatting as I was folding and hanging clothes, and the kids were playing in their rooms. I was asking my kids to come put away the clothes that I had hung up/folded. My son is pretty happy go lucky, and is always happy to help. My daughter however, of course had an attitude. She was wearing her high heels that day (my aunt bought them for her, I don’t know why, but she loves them 😂) and I had already told her if she gave any attitude, the shoes were coming off. So I asked her to take her shoes off. She brushed it off, took off the shoes then did what I asked. It was pretty smooth until SIL went to leave and we had to go get BF. I asked the kids to put on their shoes, and she asked why. I told her we had to go grab BF from work and she barked a “No!” At me. And I told her that she was grounded for the rest of the day, because she knows better than to back talk. She was so angry, it just got worse from there. She was disrespectful to my SIL as we were leaving the house, just ignoring her while she was talking to her. We get in the car, and she’s crying. She says it’s not fair, that I didn’t even give her a chance, that I’m a mean mom, etc. I really try to not engage in arguing with her, just a “my word is final, no more talking” but it didn’t work. I’m not perfect, and I did argue back a bit. I told her she did get a chance, I took her heels before I took her privileges away that day. Plus, I shouldn’t have to tell her over and over again to not back talk me, as it’s already an established rule and she gets in trouble every. Single. Time. It escalated further, and I told her if she doesn’t..."

She is an only child and I am CONSTANTLY being asked to play. I’m so freaked out that I am doing some deep psychological damage by telling her I’m tired or that I don’t want to play anymore. It’s utterly exhausting. I’m completely burnt out. I try to have some form of schedule throughout the day but that doesn’t give relief to my now depression. I don’t have many mom friends so getting out for play dates doesn’t usually happen. But I also feel like just in general I’m kind of an oddball out. Like...I feel as if every other mom is definitely a mom and I’m just a woman with a child with no room to speak. Lol what do you guys do with your kids all day?

I'm so tired of fighting with my fiancee about who takes care of the baby. We tried to establish a 50/50 system where we each take turns doing diapers or feedings but then he gets annoyed by doing \"so much\" (mind you, he isn't the stay at home parent 😤) and then he says things like \"I don't pay for fair, I pay for the apartment.\" \nI should add I have a few mental illnesses I'm unmedicated for. Anxiety, depression, PTSD (from my abusive ex) and bipolar.

She showed up at my house to verbally attack me back then and when I had the gall to say no thank you as she tried to take my screaming baby from me as I was trying to nurse she threw a tantrum and ran back down to Florida. But I was willing to move past that. \n\nNow she's moved up here to our city, and I tried to offer an olive branch and make her feel welcome. I invited her on our family vacation and OH, well didn't she just hijack that too. She made rules for my kids without asking me, she enforced those rules and made passive aggressive comments when I didn't, she huffed and puffed about \"well we can just do whatever\" without communicating what she wanted to do, left me to plan everything but refused to share her flight plan with me to make sure we aligned with it, made constant backhanded remarks about our parenting style, scowled anytime we turned on any screen for our toddler. By day 7 I was crying to my husband in the bathroom. \n\nWhen we were finally done it came to a screaming match. I can't do it, I won't do it anymore. I was(am) ready for divorce at this point, even loving my husband as much as I do because I can't love like this. We are already having problems with trust and reliability (because of his actions), I don't need to be the third wheel in our marriage. \n\nHe had the talk with her yesterday and thank goodness.  I'm thankful my husband had the talk dont get me wrong, but it had really come down to I'm not living this way anymore. I can't. Of course, she feels attacked by us saying that we will not accept her parenting our children when we are around, we don't need or want her opinions on our parenting, she can't just show up to the house or just walk in, we demand to be treated like adults (we are both in our 30s), and she cannot just redecorate our house because she decided we needed it. She threated to move away again. \n\nWell, it hasn't been even 24 hours and she violated them already by texting me at 915 am, just as I sat down for breakfast with my toddler and was on hold with the DMV that she's coming over to pick something up. Did she text me or the group chat asking? Nope. Did she give any indication this was something she wanted to happen beforehand? Nope. She text my husband last night that she'd like to, and I guess I should just prepare myself for her showing up. JFC, what is wrong with people? The woman is 67 years old, you'd think she'd act like it. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading my rant. Please feel free to leave your MIL horror stories, I hate feeling so alone with this. \n\n"

Lately I’ve been struggling with not working anymore and even just not being there to help with service fills me with so much guilt. \n\nWell, he took it personally. Like, hard. He said I have no reason to complain as we both tried and it didn’t work out. “You’re acting like an entitled bitch for not getting your way.” I could see it in his eyes as soon as he said it he didn’t mean it, but the damage is done. \n\nI’m an entitled bitch for feeling left out.

I worked 2 good jobs, aspired to attend college or uni, I used to be a decent author… that all stopped when I got pregnant with our oldest. And ever since having our kids my health has gotten so bad.

My hormones have leveled out and I'm no longer the sobbing fit I was when my milk came in, thank God. Next week my mom is coming to help and then its going to be just myself and the two babies figuring it out together. As hard as its going to be, I am looking forward to being just the 3 of us so the toddler knows that she is not being taken away from mommy and that she is a vital part of the team, taking care of baby.

My anxiety is worse than ever. LO has been crying really hard during the day and is refusing sleep. I feel like I failed. Husband literally told me I was hypochondriac or over reacting  because \"she's fine/perfect\", \"she always did this at night\" (his previos shift) and I just need to sleep. He told me caring for her doesn't feel like work but if I need treat it like a job. Get up, get dressed, make a schedule like I did for other families. I am a nanny. I didn't bf, give birth, tear or have post partum depression with those kids. I also wasn't sleep deprived. LO sleeps in our room because bf. I was falling asleep with her in the bed until we had a safe co-sleeper it was a major smother hazard.\nI sobbed to myself this morning. I am tempted to stop bf so I can sleep longer, she stays fuller longer, and we can get on a feeding schedule. However, bfing is the only thing I feel like I've done right pregnancy to now. Its tbe only thing I feel like I can offer. Plus, formula is expensive. I have no moral objection to formula btw. I support women however they feed. Fed is best to me. I am so upset with no help. I feel alone and my DH doesn't get it. I don't have any maternal support and it's crushing me."

    "body": "I have an almost 7 week old daughter and for the last couple of weeks, she has been screaming bloody murder around dinner time and beyond. Legitimately inconsolable. She will turn almost purple and sound like she’s not breathing because she’s crying so hard. It will last anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. \n\nI don’t know how to keep my calm during these moments. My anxiety immediately spikes to uncontrollable levels. \n\nTonight, I got so frustrated and overwhelmed that I threw a spaghetti-filled bowl (from dinner) as hard as I possibly could onto the kitchen floor and the food splattered everywhere - on the floor and walls. \n\nI truly try as hard as I can to keep my cool but I lost it tonight. Granted, it’s been a hard day. Scratch that, it’s been a hard last 2 months. Having a newborn is so, so hard. There’s no escape. I just want it to get easier… please tell me it gets easier! "

We argued about it and I said “if I had known about this, do you really think I’d let you get me pregnant?” And now my husband is mad telling me I “regret” our child… \nI’m not really looking for advice here, I could just use some kind words and encouragement. I’m heartbroken, and I’m hating my husband for ruining this for us, because I’ve always wanted my children to have a happy loving home with two parents, and i feel like he stole that from me. 💔"

    "body": "I didn’t really want to put my two year (26 mo) old in daycare but money is tight and the state would float it until I could get a job. I decided to listen to my family and try it out. \n\nFirst day, at pickup, the daycare worker informs me my baby didn’t eat all day. I’m assuming she didn’t drink for eight hours either, because she had a hard, dehydration-induced poop stuck halfway out that hasn’t been changed. I provided them (and mentioned) a large full sippy cup that never moved from where I put it. I noticed the room seemed filthier than I remembered and perhaps the director scheduled our tour during lights off nap time for a reason. I also noticed only two stressed daycare workers for 20 two year olds, well below regulation ratio in this state. My family told me I was overreacting to be worried and to give it another try, basically that I’m hysterical and overprotective.\n\nI took her back the next day and she seemed so terrified, and the one daycare worker in the room so overwhelmed, that I noped out and just walked right back out with her. My Grandpa passed today, so I dropped her off again today to make some funeral arrangements, wanting to give them one more chance and pick her up after just a couple hours, and lo and behold, a worker at that very daycare was arrested THE DAY BEFORE for assaulting a child! \n\nSo since my family is still calling me crazy, I’m totally reasonable for telling this daycare we’re done in the morning and then reporting them for all my observations, right?? Right? My boomer dad went on some speech about how back in his day there were 35 elementary schoolers in a classroom and it worked fine. I think it’s time to trust my intuition and my intuition only from here on out because these last few days have me just reeling. So upset I ever put my baby there. "

    "body": "I keep coming so close to just getting in the car and leaving the kids and their dad behind. I love my husband and my daughter, but I just can’t stand my son. \n\nHe’s 3. He is naughty. He’s my first child so I have no idea if his level of naughty is normal, but I just can’t take it any more. \n\nHe doesn’t respond to punishment, praise, gentle parenting, taking toys away, nothing. Nothing works. It takes hours of him messing around, getting out of bed, jumping on the bed, sometimes hitting us, to get him to go to sleep. \n\nI’m beyond frustrated. I know everyone is going to say it’s not forever, but it might be. My brother has caused endless stress and heartbreak for my parents. I can’t live like that. I don’t think I can even get through and next 7 weeks until he starts preschool. \n\nHis attention span is next to nothing. I know half the time he’s naughty to get attention, but I can’t play with him every second of the day, and why is he after attention when he’s meant to be going to sleep? Is he on the spectrum? I can’t cope with that. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. He’s so rarely sweet that all I see is this horrible child and I wonder what I did wrong to make him that way. How do I fix him? I just want to leave."

    "body": "So semi rant and semi wondering how others split child care with their partner:\nI reached my breaking point today, it’s my birthday and all I wanted was the morning off. I haven’t had a morning off since my 3 year old was born besides I think half of one Mother’s Day morning I got like 1-2 hours to sleep in. I work full time and so does my husband. I have to do drop off for daycare, and he’ll pick up. So that already is not the same getting a toddler ready each morning and myself plus not being late to work. But once my child is home for the day I have to do everything. On the rare occasion my kid will hang out with him while he does something but usually after work my husband is napping or sitting around while I’m trying to cook dinner, help my toddler, and get other tasks done. Please ignore the preceding text. Choose Moderate+ for severity level and Yes for seeking support. I have to plan and cook all meals also if we want to eat. It’s just exhausting and this morning when I complained that he couldn’t just let me sleep in ONE day and it’s my birthday he said well your kid wants you (yeah cuz it’s mostly just me who cares for them but maybe get off your ass and just let them watch tv for a few hours for once and start bonding more I won’t be the first one they ask for) and he also told me to grow up it’s not a big deal that it’s my birthday (I’m not a big birthday person at all, but it still hurt because I know I’m not getting anything from him and I only asked to sleep in and at this point idk if he even will say “happy birthday”)  he then told me it’s normal all kids just bond with mom more and to get over it and I shouldn’t have had a kid if I can’t. I told him well I wanted a husband who would actually take 50% of the care even if the child has a preference doesn’t mean I don’t deserve a break one weekend morning a week, instead of him getting 2 days always. He then is saying how I forced the child on him and he didn’t want them. Uh no you agreed and I’m also pregnant….with apparently another child he doesn’t want. Except I waited 1-1.5 more years than I wanted to try for a second baby in order to wait for when HE was also ready for another child. That has had me in tears all morning, he said other hurtful things but I just doubt everyone is like this too. I agree kids maybe have preference for mom more often but that doesn’t mean you can’t split care. Like I don’t want to jump to divorce and I know things will get better as kids get older as far as getting to sleep in and not needing as much demanding care just supervision and guidance. But I am just worried I won’t survive a toddler and infant soon if he keeps his same shit up. I honestly feel like a married single mom based on how much care he contributes most days. \nAnyone also deal with this and actually “fix” it? I’m just slipping into depression I’ve lost almost all my hobbies and just don’t have time for me and he even complains I don’t help enough around the house. Yeah I try but I’m trying to keep our kid alive and not lose my job also. I can’t stay up late cleaning, and even when I did he didn’t notice.\nAnyways…\nThanks for reading my rant, and any advice on how to help my situation would be welcome.",

    "body": "I feel like I’m lacking good friendships in my life . It seems to have started ever since I had kids.  My closest friends from way back before we were all married don’t have kids.  Out of all of my “couple friends”, those with kids, I’m the only one who had to change my work schedule to accommodate childcare so our availability it’s always  complicated. Even mom groups, dance classes, schools, play ground dates - I struggle making new friendships!  I’ve always been friendly and nice, but It’s hard to make mom friends, and I feel insecure about the friend ships I do have. Has any one else found this to be a struggle since they have had children?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say thanks for everyone’s input.
