    "body": "Tw : possible rape \n\nI went to a weekend in a chalet for the 30th birthday of one of my best friend. We were 20 and I felt safe because I knew most of the people there. \n\nIn these 20 people was a friend that doesn’t live in the same country anymore but came to visit. In the past, we had flirted and made out a few times but I didn’t want it to go further because I felt he was a bit too pushy and kind of brutal in his way of kissing, touching, grabbing etc. \n\nWe partied all night long and at the end we were all pretty drunk, and he called me to bring him a cigarette so I went into his room and then it’s just blurry. I don’t know if I consented to a bit of what happened but I sure remember not wanting to do it. \nI told him I didn’t want to do it because now I’m in a relationship, I also was on my period and just wasn’t into it. \nHe made me suck his dick by pushing my head and then went on to do anal. I told him multiple times that it was hurting me and that I didn’t want it but it was just as if I was talking to a wall. He was saying “you want it you’re turned on”. And so, as what was happening was disturbing I kind of thought “I might as well try to enjoy it” and get “into it” but truth is I just wanted it to be over, so I asked him to penetrate me in the vagina instead of the ass which he did. \nIt still hurt. He chocked me so hard I was close to pass out, he was telling that he had waited a long time for this to happen. He didn’t finish and did not have condoms anymore so I persuaded him to stop there and just go to sleep. \nAfter he fell asleep I went down into my room and cried. I went to the bathroom and saw blood coming from my anus. \nThe morning after that he was acting perfectly normal, hugging and kissing me as if nothing weird has happened. \n\nI don’t know if this his a rape. I don’t remember all of it, I probably at some point gave consent for part of the stuff that happened, I went into his room, I didn’t got up and left. \nAt the end of it I was “participating” in the sex act. I’m lost and sad. \n\n\nI don’t really know what I expect from this post."

But I feel like I’m being creepy every time I ask because I know I’m trying to imitate her look, and I know the best thing is to strengthen your own look, but… I don’t think I have my own look. \n\nI don’t think I dress well. I don’t think I look good. I will never have the same curves she has unless I get plastic surgery, and my hair will never look as nice no matter what I do to it. When I pour all my efforts into my looks, I feel mildly pretty at best, but I also have a fear that people look at me like I’m trying too hard. And then when I go out when I’m feeling good, I get scared because I don’t want to attract the wrong attention.\n\nThis sounds very self defeating, but I just needed someone other than my boyfriend to talk to about this."

They disregarded her feelings, demanded she go with them, said she couldn't see me again, could never go to inpatient care, that mental healthcare was worthless, and told me that it’s a man’s job to tell a woman when she isn't thinking right.\n\nI tried to stand up for her, but it's clear my ex wanted this to stop and started agreeing with him. I didn't know what to do and was suffering from some pretty serious trauma so I called the cops.\n\nA few days later she called me over, her father was there, she told me I shouldn't have tried to keep her family from her and tell the cops she was crazy, she said she had never been suicidal and that she never wanted to go to inpatient care. When I questioned her on this her father said, even if it was true, I should have told you not to go.\n\nAfter leaving her ex, her parents were responsible for her apartment, car,  job, and savings.\n\nIt's been about 2 months and I'm still shattered. Things got messy from there and I don't deny that my emotional state caused me to make several mistakes while trying to help her and figure out what was going on.\n\nIf you lovely ladies have any thoughts you could share, either to tell me off, give me a new perspective, or anything I would be grateful."

Like more than I can remember if being asked on the spot. \n\nI‘ve been followed in broad daylight quite a few times. When the guy is in a car it’s really scary to me (a guy tried to smooth talk me into his van once as I was sitting on my stoop minding my business). The last time this happened, a guy in a truck followed me an entire mile after I flashed my wedding ring and told him I wasn’t interested. I was pregnant at the time and terrified because physically I was more vulnerable. \n\nI‘ve been followed at night. The last time it happened, the guy actually picked me up off my feet and walked with me and I had to fight “playfully “ to get him to put me down. Believe me, I still wtf? when I think back on that one. \n \nAnd the last time I was followed in broad daylight by a guy on foot was 2 weeks ago when I was on an errand buying necessities for my 5 month old who I couldn’t wait to get back to afterwards. \n\nWhen I’m being followed I first think, god, not again. Then I think how am I going to get out of this or I hope he doesn’t touch me. While it’s happening I am usually thinking nothing. Survival mode? After it happens I’m frustrated, creeped out and angry. Especially now that I have a kid. \n\nAnd the men I’ve told just don’t get it. I assume these men don’t follow women, but they still don’t get it even as a “crime” against common decency. The worst reactions are the laughs and/or jokes about it. Or the disbelief. Or the non reaction like it wasn’t a big deal and obviously nothing happened. What do you mean nothing happened? A bigger and stronger person purposefully followed me and that in itself is threatening. Duh?\n\nWhat gives?"

I myself am just one of many cases and it continues to haunt me more than 15 years later. \n\nI [now 33F] was 12 and he was 22 and we \"met\" online. I told him in the beginning that I was 16 (as if that somehow made it better) but eventually told him the truth about my age and the \"relationship\" continued. Until I was 17.\n\nMy parents were getting divorced, I was lonely and felt neglected and it was nice I could have someone to talk to. Even if it often became sexual. \n\nHe often talked about marrying me, what our children would be like and painted this whole life together. He eventually became very possessive and would often force me to stay up into the wee hours of the morning on the phone with him even though I might've had school the next day. \n\nMore than once I tried to break it off with him and explained that I felt like I was being robbed of my childhood. His response would always be something manipulative and I would remain with him. \n\nMy parents knew. Maybe not the full extent of things since I wasn't comfortable to come out and say these things aloud (I'm still not). After my parents divorce, I stayed with my mom. She never tried to put a stop to it or explain why this relationship was wrong. I don't think this was due to negligence or shitty parenting - I think she just didn't know how to handle it and had so many other things going on at that time. And I wonder, if she had taken the time to sit down and talk to me about it, would I have listened? I don't know.\n\nYears later it still bothers me. Most days I don't think about it. I'm in a much better place in my life, in a good and healthy relationship, and have a better relationship with my parents now that I'm older and they're thankfully long divorced. We never talk about it and tbh I don't want to talk about it. It always makes me feel a little nauseous and dirty.\n\nSince it's disgustingly common, if you or someone you knew was groomed, how do you live with it?

Some of them think I’m desperate for a partner, when in reality I’m just reflecting on where I’m at in my life.\n\nI don't sit around crying about being single, I’m very happy with my life in general. I absolutely love my job, I have hobbies, great friends, a wonderful family and an alright social life. I’m told I’m funny, I’m easy to talk to and I wouldn’t say I was ugly (but obviously I’m no model haha). I just can't shake this feeling of inadequacy. Like time is kinda running out.\n\nI spent my early 20s focusing on my studies, my friends and myself. I never cared about being in a relationship, I always just figured it was one of those things that would happen. Then I turned 25 and it dawned on me that I wasn't where I expected to be in life. I'd never had a gf. I'd never had sex. I'd never even kissed a girl.\n\nThis past year I set about making an effort to put myself out there more. I went on about 5 dates (I can now say that I have actually made out with a girl haha) but none of them really went anywhere. Either they weren’t into me, or I knew it didn’t have much of a future. I also struggle to escalate things on a date to touch or kissing. On top of that I’ve never really felt comfortable with the idea of casual relationships or casual sex just to have an outlet for sex. I guess I just feel like waiting for someone that I really want to have sex with, not just someone that I'd be okay with having sex with. But again, as the clock rolls on and I’m on the verge of 26 I’m starting to wonder if I’m holding myself back in that regard.\n\nI keep trying to make positive steps to improve myself as a person. In the next couple of months I’m moving out of my parents to have my own space and independence, regardless of the money side of things. I’m going to go to cooking lessons in the new year to learn a skill I’ve always wanted. Basically, I want to be the best version of me that I can be. \n\nI don’t think being in a relationship makes you happy. It annoys me that society basically says that, if you are single, you’re somehow lacking. But with all that said I still circle back round in my mind to this question ‘why hasn’t it happened yet?’ and with each failed date, or rejection, I have to try harder and harder. Every so often this past year I feel a bit hopeless even though I know I have a great life…\n\nBasically, I’m not really sure why I’m posting… I guess I’m wondering if any of this is something that would put girls off a guy? Should I just get over my hangs ups about casual sex and just do it when I get the chance next to get it out the way? Or is it worth it to keep waiting for somebody I see real potential in, or feel a connection to? Is that something that girls would even care about/appreciate? I also don’t even really know where to meet girls? I hate clubs and don’t really have a friend group that is single to help me meet girls so I feel alone in that respect too."

We were two of the four last people to leave. \n\nRight now its truly only a work crush, we chitchat and glance at each other many times in a day. \n\nI believe that this crush has happened because things at home isnt the best right now. We are both so busy and tired at night. We never have sex anymore and when we do, i have to initiate. I feel like we have become roommates. \nIm sure that if things had amazing at home, then my crush probably wouldnt have happened. \n\nIm so frustrated and sad right now, and I dont have anyone to talk to about this. Has anyone been in my shoes? Like, what do I do?"

I looked at all the size 2 girls in the room and felt stupid for even considering the fact he was serious. I've gain about 50 lbs over the last 2 years, so my weight is really sensitive. I've felt the erasure that comes with gaining weight, but I've never been the blatant end of a fat joke. \n\nMy friends were super cool, word got around that it happened and the party dropped from 25 to 5 people in like 5 mins. The support I got from my friends was incredible, and I'm so thankful things couldn't go further. \n\nI just can't help but say to myself over and over \"You used to be attractive, but now you're fat and alone\".

    "body": "\nSo before we got married, my husband bought and now owns a house. He had 4 roommates living with him, all male. The house was basically a frat house and not kept clean. I moved in and the roommates moved out. I have been slowly making it better. Painting one room at a time, getting new toilets, new blinds, when we can afford it. \n\nHis mother came over sometime two years ago (about the time I moved in) and realized the house had went really down hill from the guys. She complimented me on what I was doing and for Christmas last year said she would pay to re do our outside patio. Nothing has come of that but that’s not this story. \n\nSo I recently started on a new project to paint a small bathroom. It had wallpaper in it and I’ve never dealt with wallpaper and I got all of the things to remove it and it was just not coming down so my husband offered to pay his moms boyfriend to come get it down for me.\n\nThey said no need to pay and that would come help for free. So thankful! So they came and started to take it down and his mom decided to do a total makeover on this bathroom. New floors, lights, sink, all the stuff. I’m so so thankful and it’s turning out way better then if I had just painted it. \n\nSo I am a stay at home wife(hoping to be a stay at home mom some day.) Anyways, I do all of the cleaning and all of the cooking. I’m on a pretty strict schedule and I like for my house to be clean. No dishes in the sink, laundry done, stuff like that. \n\nSo she’s been in our house the past week working on the bathroom with her boyfriend and there’s soo much construction stuff laying around. Just everywhere. So I’ve decided to sit back for these days and not clean like I normally would until everyone is out and I can get back into my groove. I am already someone that needs space and I don’t love having people over for long periods of time so I’m kinda of just taking a week off of work basically.\n\nToday they were over here end she walked by the dishes in the sink and said y’all live like slobs to my husband. I wasn’t there. He stood up for me and said it’s normally really spotless in here, it’s just because all of the bathroom stuff is everywhere and she shrugged it off.\n\nSo my question is, should I confront her? We have an okay relationship. She has a strong/loud personality and I’m more of an introvert so I haven’t always went to an event or dinner she’s asked me to attend and that’s hurt her feelings in the past. \n\nMy feelings are hurt right now though because my house is normally super clean and organized and I just feel like it was uncalled for.   I don’t know. Help?"

It's nice to be hopeful and positive, to be aware of the other options available. Sperm donation, IVF, surrogacy, fostering, adoption, are all amazing options for women to become mothers. \n\n\nAfter multiple miscarriages and just recently a stillbirth with a hysterectomy, my body gave up. My heart gave up. My brain is now taking over and the fairytale of having a family is over. I got a lot of comments saying \"why are you pregnant if you are poor?\", \"why were you trying to have a baby homeless and single?\", \"Thank god you got sterilized, now get a job!\". I was trying and conceiving my pregnancies I wasn't who I am right now. I was with a partner of many years, living in a beautiful 2,300 sq ft home, a baby fund “nest egg”, my “job” was becoming a mother. I didn’t know about the extreme manipulation going on, literally oblivious. I didn’t know how vile he and his family were.\n\n\nI didn’t mention this next part but after my trip to Maine not being what I thought it was going to be until I got there, I went back “home”. I needed shelter and I needed my money. I needed shelter and I needed my money and I was so angry that he manipulated me for so many years. I felt brave and wanted to stand up for myself. He assaulted me so badly that he is sitting in the Regional Justice Center with his bail denied, despite his mother trying to get him out and threatening me to drop the charges. After my motel days are up, I have nowhere to go to continue recovering. \n\n\nThe shelter I was at was only for expecting mothers and mothers with children, which I no longer am. I'm terrified. I don’t have a car anymore. I don’t know where my next meal is coming from. I don’t have family. I haven’t worked in over 5 years, by choice which doesn’t entice pity for help locally. Recovering from a traumatic medical procedure. All of this means I can’t try adopting a child, disqualified, unfit, denied. It would be extremely irresponsible to even try as I'll be rebuilding my life for the next couple years. I have to let the fantasy of motherhood go. \n\n\n\nI know my life isn’t over, I have a tiny bit of hope that I’ll get back on my feet but having “another” child just isn’t going to happen. Pouring my heart out here was more for me than it was for having a bunch of strangers know how big of a failure I am. Again, I know suggestions are coming from the heart, I just can't keep dreaming.\n\n Tl;dr: Screaming my newfound realizations into existence even if no one cares."

I fell in love with him a few months after becoming friends with him. However, I knew he wasn't into me like that, plus I'm working through a lot of issues (PTSD and trying to get a bachelors [also a mental illness, imo]) so i know any serious relationship isn't right for me right now. Fast forward a year. He met my best friend. Had a crush on her instantly. My best friend knows how much I was in love with him. Just every choice she's made since then has been selfish from my eyes. Such as, being all over him in front of me. He cut me out of his life shortly after, completely shocking and devastasting me. He essentially told her (paraphrasing) when they afterward went on a date, \"I'm not attracted to her. Never have been. I knew she liked me but i like you so I dropped her. She was trying to make you look bad to win me over anyway, I want to date you.\"  She seems to be ok with this and is giving him a chance. I am devastated. I don't even know what to feel right now. She says I'm being immature and dramatic and I should just be happy for her. But I'm reeling from the loss of who I thought was one of my best friends-and his false accusations of me. And I'm also feeling shocked and kind of betrayed from her as well. Am i being immature or is this a bad friendship?\n\nEdit:\nIf this detail matters, she doesn't have a crush or any real interest in him. part of what makes it feel selfish to me. She is moving next year and just wants to have a \"fling\" relationship in the meantime. She gets plenty of male attention so I feel it's insensitive. "

I went over to his place and we started doing things and he put a condom on and I told him that I didn’t want to have sex with that day because I didn’t feel ready but still he tried to but I was too nervous and my body didn’t let him in. After this he acted hurt and shit saying that he wasn’t attractive enough or whatever but really I felt like shit and now I don’t wanna have sex with him or do stuff with him. I told him that I felt like he didn’t care about what I told him and he said he knows that he went over the limit and that he is sorry and that it will never happen again but I really trusted him before and I would have never even thought he wouldn’t stop when I told him no and now he really lost my trust. \n\nNow I don’t know what to do because he says he really loves me and I love him too but this kinda made me reevaluate our relationship and I wanna give him another chance but I don’t really feel good anymore but he thinks I moved on and that everything is good.\n\nedit: actually I told him again that I was bothered that he cared so little so we talked about it again and I told him how I felt and I had no reply and he only said he is sorry and understands what he did wrong.

I know what he did was wrong but I am just not strong enough to break it and I need advice\n\nand also he is really emotional and I think this might break him bc he started crying begging for a second chance when talked through the phone and met and he said that he loves me more than he ever loved and that we would rather never have sex than to break up and that he is willing to change everything to be back with me and I don’t know if I should believe him or not"

    "body": "I don't understand why I get so much pushback from other feminists and women about this. \n\nEvery little part of me, every little part of my body, every little interest I have or characteristic I harbor is sexualized in some form. My legs are sexualized, my shoulders, my stomach, my hobbies, my interests, my career. Everything just seen as another porn category or flavor of woman for the men's picking. I can't talk about my interests without \"that's so hot\" or \"men like that\". Can't have a career without it being expressed to me how attractive it is to men. Can't have a body without unsolicited comments and leering over just existing. \n\nAnd when I express this I always get yelled over about how I'm trying to control people's minds or that I am a puritan or something and it's so tiring. Yeah, I can't control people's thoughts, but how is it not bull crap to anyone else that women can't exist in any way that *isn't* relative to sex. Even if they're \"unattractive\" everyone focuses on the *absence* of sex appeal. And it is no secret that this incessant sexual ranking of women is used as a means to disrespect them.\n\nI shouldn't have to overhear my male colleagues breaking down the sexual desirability of my female colleagues and talking about them as less-than because of it. I shouldn't have to worry about my voice and skills not ever mattering because people will look at me and only see me as a ranked list of sexual appeal. Its hard to see female political figures and professionals get pornified (even a young girl like Thunberg) as a means to dismiss them as a sex object that can't hold thoughts or power. I shouldn't have to see women get sexualized because men are *angry* at them and want to remind them they're things to be used. I shouldn't have to worry about men taking pictures of me or women I know to \"use\" later like I'm some species or thing that only exists for them.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter if there's women out there that find empowerment in sexualization. They are allowed to do that voluntarily with their consent. That doesn't mean that every single woman on this Earth should be looked at only through a pornographic lens. It doesn't matter even if these thoughts are kept to themselves if it still means they see women as lesser because they're always reducing them to sex in their heads.  A racist can keep racist thoughts in their head but they're still horrible feelings to harbor and possibly act upon. \n\nI'm not a bad person for not wanting to constantly be reduced to this in the gaze of men or even women. I don't know why this is controversial even in feminism and it makes me feel like I will never, ever be able to exist as anything other than a *thing* that represents sexual use.\n\nEdit: This got more support than expected, so thank you to those who commented. It really helped my mental health. I felt alone with this concern. Let's all hope we can see the changes we want to be."

    "body": "Very sorry if this is long tried to give as much backstory/detail without being overly detailed. My boyfriend (26 M) and I (26 F) have known each other since we were in 8th grade. I had a crush on him however he wasn’t ready date. A year later we were freshmen and he was my first kiss when we got to HS. We didn’t date in HS but we kept contact and I ended up getting into another relationship. Our senior year we decided to do all of the dances together, and went on our first date. At this point I wasn’t ready to date since I had just gotten out a relationship. However, after senior year we were both ready and We officially begin dating after high school ended. We moved in together October 2023 and I feel that’s where a lot of our issues began. Within the first 3 months of us living together he began changing and saying the opposite of things we had both been in agreement to prior to moving in together Examples: 1. buying a house, something we had not talked about, and thought was at least a year away conversation, since we had only lived together 3 months. However he went ahead and signed us up for a home buying seminar and took me to it. I had no clue we were signed up until a week before. 2. He then began talking about kids. Throughout the whole relationship I emphasize I didn’t want to have kids. He even voluntarily suggested him getting a vasectomy within the last year. I didn’t push him to it or anything and he never brought it up again. But now he was saying he might want kids. Specifically 5. 3. He also began talking about us moving out farther where there’s a lot of land even thought we both said we wanted to stay in area/surrounding area we grew up in. 4. Purchasing a firearm. He brought it up one night and I said okay let’s go through gun safety classes, getting a gun license and finding the best fire arm for both of us. When I had to retake the home buying class he went and bought a firearm without the previous agreed upon steps. He texted me”I’m heading to the gun store” I responded “are you looking at guns”. to his response “I’m sure I’ll do that too while I’m there”. It just seems that the person I thought I knew I no longer know, we have argued a good bit since living together. My main grievance is that we don’t spend time together. I go to bed by myself 4/5 nights out of the week. He goes to record podcasts with his friends two nights a week and then works on stuff for his new business in the evening since he works full time during the day. We don’t go on dates except for specific occasions (Valentine’s Day & Anniversary). We didn’t even go out for my birthday this year because I didn’t want to change dresses- so he cancelled the reservation. Prior to us moving in we spent quality time together and I was pretty happy with the relationship. However even through all of this he still said he wanted to go through premarital counseling and that we need to get married. There were multiple occasions were he said we need to get married within the next two weeks. He emphasized just going to the courthouse to get married. I had no problem going to the courthouse compared to a wedding but why the urgency all of a sudden? He said he didn’t feel he needed to buy a fancy ring. I don’t think I’ve ever wanted anything to crazy just a ring letting me know he was committed. On Tuesday night my boyfriend broke up with me. He said it was because he needed to work on giving himself self love. I asked him if there was anyone else. He said no. I asked if he saw us getting back together after he worked on self love and he said he didn’t know what the future held. He then offered for me to have his dog. I told him “no that’s your dog “ and he said” I think God wants you to have her” I said “ well we have 6 months to figure it out” since we have six months left on the lease. The rest of that night went great. We got dinner together, did puzzles, played uno, and had sex (I know we shouldn’t have done that one). I asked him how he felt about the evening and he said he enjoyed it. I asked if the next couple of months went like this would he consider getting back together. He said yes. The next morning I double checked because I didn’t want him to feel pressured he said he thought it would take more than 2 months, but probably not. I said I understood. The rest of the day we didn’t speak. The next morning I had a dream about him dating another girl. I asked him again if there was anyone else and he said yes. This crushed me. He then went on to say he hadn’t had contact with her and he had just been thinking about her a lot. I asked if once he feels okay to be in a relationship with this. Be the first person he reached out to and he said “let’s say yes”. I asked where they met and he said back in 2017/2019 at our college however he claims not to have her number. And that she no longer has an Instagram (apparently he tried looking for her recently since they use to follow each other). This crushed me because he’s saying he’s been thinking about her for the last month but in the same hand was saying we need to do premarital counseling and get married. It just..."

Her husband provided a cost/benefit analysis for the HR rep in regards to them being relocated to their headquarters. They live in a low-cost area, while the headquarters is located in a high-cost living area by a major city. My friend and her husband do not make enough to live in said city, and this fact was pointed out to the rep.\n\nMy friend said there was an immediate reply from the HR rep, thanking them for bringing this to their attention, and they would be speaking to said boss that made those comments.\n\nThe following week the husband received an apology from the boss regarding his comments, and said he would not ask the husband to relocate to major city. From what my friend shared with me, this man hasn't made any more comments about her voice or the noise in the condo.\n\nShe's pretty happy with the outcome, now that she doesn't have to move or worry about some other man's opinions about her voice. Makes me wish I had the ability to be that gutsy, or professionally petty."

    "body": "Not sure if this is a good place to post this. 1/2 rant, 1/2 advice I guess.\n \nSome women from Mary Kay came into my work (a pizza place) a few weeks ago saying they were \"empowering women in the community.\" They gave me and female customers one of those dissolving skin things and ask if they can enter me in a drawing. I should have said no but I'm 18 and dumb and didn't think I'd win so I said ok.\n\nFlash forward a few days and I \"won.' I get an enthusiastic text from the lady I saw at my work and she says I have to come to a class to get my gift card. I'm busy and getting ready for college but I reluctantly go to this shady strip mall location and attend the damn class. I have no interest in makeup, and very little in skin care products. I have no money to spend on Mary Kay (why do you think I'm making pizza?!).\n\nThe class was two hours (should have been one) of chaos and some embarrassment. There were some other girls there who were actually interested in makeup. I felt the entire time like the women working for Mary Kay were shaming me because of my skin. I don't have perfect skin, but it's a hell of a lot better than it used to be, and I'm allergic to a lot of products so there is only so much I can do. I'd also spent part of the day crying my eyes out for unrelated reasons. The whole time they're recommending the more intense \"treatment\" stuff for me to sample while telling everyone else, \"you have good skin, you don't need to use that.\" They also spent forever scanning my face with their phones just to tell me I have acne and an uneven skin tone. Thanks.\n\nFinally, the appointment was over, and I was allowed to spend my $25 gift card, which I guess was imaginary bc I never saw a physical card. I \"bought\" a charcoal mask ($25) and nothing else. I'm told it will be delivered the next day, and here we are ten days later. It's not here. \n\nI'm pretty pissed. These women manipulated and humiliated me, and I would like to receive the product I was offered. I have texted the woman a few times with no response.\n\nAnyone have a similar experience? As stupid as it sounds, I really want the item I got with my gift card. Even if she's not going to make a buck off of it. I wasted a lot of time that day just for that product, and I feel ripped off. What's worse is I made a DELICIOUS pizza for that woman that day, just because I try to be a good employee and a good person when I wake up in the morning. Why is it that I can do my job without hurting others and she can't? And her job (harassing women) seems a hell of a lot easier than mine. \n\nTl;dr: Mary Kay sucks. Don't fall for it."

On the way back, he received a phone call, from his kids mother… this strikes me as odd because I don’t believe in coincidences and thought it was weird because he received a call at a time when he was out and when he knew that I usually would not be with him. \n\nHe NEVER asks me if I want to go shop with him he just says he’s going to the shop and if I want anything. I know why I mentioned the anxiety beforehand, but he knows that I am trying to get out more and said that he will help with that and we agreed that I should start small. I.e the shop. \n\nI don’t know if he is cheating, but this feels like some kind of emotional type cheating or he is trying to not let me see that he is more friendly with her then he let on. "

I’m not saying that women are shallow or 2-faced bitches; I just don’t like female friendships.\n \nI’m going to start this by saying I have empathy issues. I’m not like a heartless #sigmamale Patrick Bateman type, but I just can’t feel empathy for people. I’m not an asshole; I try my hardest to be a good person, and I’m sympathetic to people, but I’m just not empathetic (it’s similar but different). \n \nFemale friendships always felt super fake to me. Not because women are fake or something, but because I needed to be fake in them. I didn’t care about my friends issues, but I was still a shoulder to cry on. I hated going out, mainly because I don’t like going places with other people, and I am an extremely fast walker, so it always felt like I was being held back by a leash, but I still did it because that’s what friends do. I held my tongue like a goddamn elementary school teacher even though I wanted to just fucking curse them out because I didn’t want to start a fight because I knew they would start crying and playing the victim even when they objectively were in the wrong (like, ok, that makes me sound like a dick  but, for example, one of my friends was being really mean to her sister, who was like 4, because she wanted to play with her. I told her that was wrong and that she should really just be nice to her sister and she started playing the victim and talking about how hard it was to have a little sister who was slightly annoying sometimes.)\n \nI did everything right. I was the perfect friend who was always supportive and kind. And what did it get me? Absolutely nothing at all. They never supported me; they would constantly talk over me, and any time I would confront them, they would tell me that they were very sorry and then go back to doing the same shit. It’s so draining having to constantly fake your emotions around people, every time I talked to them I felt so exhausted afterwards.\n \nEvery time I was with them, I would envy men. Because their friendships are superficial and shallow, but it seems so much more fulfilling. You could just shoot the shit and have fun, and you wouldn’t have to be a god damn unpaid therapist for someone.\n \nI wish I was a guy."

In January, I had just separated from my husband after an extremely traumatizing end to our relationship.\n\nI was in total survival mode. \n\nAbout three weeks after my separation, I had my annual OBGYN exam come up. I was already nervous because my provider knew I was married, so I was expecting her to ask me if I was planning on children in the near future. I did not want to have that conversation because it was so raw, but I was ready for it. \n\nWhat I was NOT ready for was for my provider to insist that I begin taking prenatal vitamins even after I clearly stated that I had absolutely no plans to have children. None. Zero. Not happening anytime soon whatsoever. \n\nTwice, I clearly stated that kids were not a part of my current plan. And twice she told me that “accidents happen so you’re better off being ready.” \n\nI left that appointment and wept because I had never felt less listened to by a medical provider, and never felt that my choices surrounding my own body were respected less than what she had shown. I thought, “maybe I should have told her about my divorce. Maybe this is my fault.” No. It wasn’t. Me saying that kids weren’t in the plan should have been the end of it. No questions asked. \n\nLooking back, there were some other red flags. She was also the one who asked me why I was using condoms with my husband. When I said “because I really really don’t want to get pregnant” she responded that I really should stop using them. \n\nThis lady seemed to view me as simply an incubator whether I wanted children or not. Needless to say, I did not return to her this year, nor did I start taking prenatal because what the actual fuck. Instead, I take good old Flintstones vitamins because fuck your prenatals."

    "body": "I'm a childfree woman in my mid 20s, and I've wanted a tubal ligation for a while now. Like some of you may have predicted, finding a surgeon willing to do this procedure was difficult for me. The first doctor I met was horrible and rude to me. I don't want to go into too many details because it was a traumatic experience for me, but the doctor basically acted like my only purpose as a woman is to pop out babies for any man who asks me to. I was ever more disappointed because this docotor is a woman and she was even recommended as good for tubal ligations by r/childfree. I'm happy some women had a good experience with her, but my experience was horrible.\n\nNext I scheduled an appointment with a doctor a three-hour drive away from me, because all the closer OBGYNs had months long wait lists.\n\nI was extremely worried going into this appointment, especially because this OBGYN is a man. I really hoped he would be able to help me.\n\nMy fears were completely unfounded. The doctor asked me a few simple questions and then scheduled my surgery without ever making me feel dehumanized.\n\nHere are the questions the doctor asked:\n\nHe asked if I had considered using other types of birth control. I told him yes but I want tubal ligation because it's permanent and almost never fails.\n\nHe told me the \"regret rate\" for women who get tubal ligations in their 20s is about 30%. He asked me if I was willing to take that risk. I said yes because I am extremely confident I won't regret it.\n\nHe told me if I have a long term male partner, we may want to discuss my partner getting a vasectomy instead of me getting a tubal ligation. I told him my partner and I have already discussed it, and we both agree it would be better for me to get the ligation.\n\nAnd that was it! The doctor said I'm an adult capable of making my own decisions, then he told me the dates he'd be available to perform the surgery.\n\nI almost wanted to give the doctor a hug because he made me feel like an actual human being. He made me feel like an equal. He NEVER asked me about the opinion of a man. He asked me if my partner and I had considered a vasectomy, but he NEVER asked for my partner's \"permission\" to get the surgery.\n\n In contrast, the first doctor I saw tried to demand an interview with my partner to ensure he gives \"permission\" for me to get sterilized. She also tried denying me the surgery because \"what if I meet a man who wants me to have kids?\" This is despite me telling her I would never date someone who wants kids because that's fundamentally incompatible with the way I want to live my life. Also, I plan to be married to my current partner for the rest of my life.\n\nI'm happy I found a good doctor but I'm disgusted that \"the doctor treated me like a human being\" is considered a high standard in the medical field."

(The cat was found later on and is now in emergency care at the vet)\n\nMy dog was shaking really hard because of all the noise and excitement and smoke and my sobbing and screaming neighbor. All of it really traumatized him. That's why when my date suggested to meet up a few hours later I declined with the reason that my dog is super panicked and I didn't want to leave him alone after going thru this scary experience. Also I didn't even know when/if I could even get back into my apartment because it wasn't clear whether they would allow us all back inside.\n\nWell that's when this guy decided it was a good idea to say that he hopes my dog dies from the smoke inhalation because apparently my dogs mental state shouldn't be more important than the dates I set up with humans. I laughed so hard and blocked him everywhere. I still cant believe this all happened today within the last 4 hours but I guess it's good that I have something ridiculous to laugh about that distracts me from this whole disaster because I would probably cry otherwise lol\n\nEDIT: I of course meant carbon monoxide, not dioxide.

It was sexist in so many ways: the men’s change room was way nicer, only men were allowed on the board of directors, only men could become “full” members, etc etc. The male members were also... not very progressive. Lots of old money, old people, old-fashioned ideas. As a young, female server, I had to deal with my fair share of condescension and sexism. This was one of the most frustrating instances. \n\nIt was a fairly slow day so I was able to make conversation with my only table: one older gentleman. Throughout the meal, he asked me odd, prying questions about myself. How old was I? Sixteen. (“I would have thought you were twenty for sure, looking like that!” was his answer.) Did I go to school? Yes, high school. Do I like working here? Obligatory yes. He also asked me what size clothing I wear. Taken aback, I told him small. (I know, I shouldn’t have told him. I was young and didn’t know how to deal with guys like that.) \n\nThe worst part was during a quality check. I will be Me and he will be Old Dude (OD). This is our conversation, as best as I can remember. \n\nMe: how is everything so far?\n\nOD: everything is copacetic!\n\nI was slightly taken aback. Yes, I knew what “copacetic” meant — it’s basically a fancy way of saying good. However, it’s not exactly the language of casual conversation.

    "title": "Advice and Confusion: The Misunderstanding and Disgust I've gotten for being a Little, in a partially Daddy Dom/Little Girl relationship is starting to get to me.",
    "body": "Hello everyone... I've commented here before, but this is the first thread I've made. The name is a pretty good TL;DR of what this is about, but I'm of course going to explain further.\n\nI'm 19 years old, and I'm a part of a Daddy Dom/Little Girl Ageplay relationship. Well, more or less. The relationship switches between that and a Mommy Dom/Little Boy relationship sometimes. Anyhow.\nMy boyfriend, who from here out shall be referred to as my Poppa, just turned 24 last month, and is the sweetest thing ever. We've been together for what will be two years on Saturday (Valentine's Day, yuck!!) and it's the happiest relationship that I've ever been in.\n\nBut like I've said, he's my Poppa. I sometimes call him that in public, I get into my \"Little\" side a LOT in public as well. I get clingy and cutesy and extremely childish.\nMaybe I should explain what exactly a Little is quick, before I go any further, for those who might be confused.\nBasically, a Little is someone who is innately childish, and feels as though at least a part of them has never grown up. The age range of Littles varies, though the most common range is between 3 and around 6. Some Littles like to draw, colour, play with toys, and dolls ,sleep with stuffed animals, watch childish cartoons, dress childishly, etc.. Some wear diapers, training pants, drink from bottles, suck on pacifiers, etc. (though as their personalities are older, they are not to be confused with Adult Babies, although there are quite a few who overlap into both).\nFor some it's sexual, for others it's completely innocent. It can also be related to Ageplay.\n\nNow that my explanation is out of the way, here's where my dilemma and feelings come in. \nWhile a lot of people I've told about this side of me have been surprisingly supportive (some even going \"Oh really, no shit. Kinda figured it out already. :p\"), some have been... The exact opposite. While this hasn't happened specifically to me yet, it's happened to a few Little friend of mine... People tend to accuse us of being Pedophiles, of being creepy perverts that get off on hurting children. They don't realize that Littles *are* children. We don't want to hurt them. We want to be them. And no, that doesn't mean that we condone child abuse either. I've heard that before as well. Just because some Littles may be in their Little personas during sexual activities, does ***not*** mean they would ever be okay with anything happening to a real child. We're adults. Inside, we know what we're doing. \nAnd often, female Littles get accused of all having \"Daddy Issues\" or wanting to fuck their real fathers, etc. etc.\nAlso very false.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with Poppa and I's relationship. Honestly, I think we're a lot closer than other couples, because we have a different type of bond on top of just our \"standard\" romantic one. He takes care of me. He cares about me an insane amount, and the smallest things he does make me extremely happy. He can get me to cheer up just by wiggling a plush around in my face. \nI don't understand what's wrong with it.\n\nBut other people just don't understand. And the hurtful comments are starting to get to me. I just don't know what to do anymore. "

    "body": "Some context:   \nI work in the film industry in an Asian country. I'm a western foreigner, the regional industry is relatively international meaning people often fly around to neighbouring countries to shoot. I built my career from 0 and I suffered a lot to make it happen. I dedicated my entire 20s to learning how to culturally integrate in a foreign country WHILE ALSO climbing the ladder / learning from scratch how to do what I do WHILE ALSO supporting (my now ex) and working to burnout to make it happen - I worked 2 jobs on top of my \"career job\" in order to build my skills and still bring home enough money to eat. I gained the respect of my team and a lot of people in my industry. I'm trusted and respected and that was all me - I moved here alone with a few hundred dollars in savings and a couch in a sharehouse with 11 people to one bathroom. It was HARD.  \n\n\nPresent day - I am moving to a neighbouring country (sharing many industry contacts, only a 1 hour flight away but a different culture) with my boyfriend who has gotten a job there. I already have the skills I need to work in this new country, and I KNOW that I can do it - there is no reason why I can't learn another language, and work with people from a different culture, I've already done it once and this time I won't also be learning how to do my job at the same time while navigating all of this, I'll have an equal partner who can share the load and a stable housing situation, enough money in the bank to not worry too much about working right away, and the industry is structured the same way as here.    \n\n\nScenario 1: I just met a director yesterday and mentioned to him that I'm planning on moving to X country soon - he had known me for all of 10 minutes and flat out said that I should probably change departments because he doesn't think a foreign woman would be able to work in my department (I work with a lot of suppliers who are older men - construction, electrical, manual labour, sometimes a bit traditional but I'm a strong communicator) despite the fact that we were sitting in a production house where nobody speaks English where I had clearly already established myself in a country with LESS foreigners doing what I do. When I politely pushed back on that suggestion (did I just spend 10 years learning my career to change it again?) he doubled down on how I wouldn't be able to work there despite having loads of industry connections already - he didn't ask me any questions about myself or my background before making this huge call about my life and abilities.   \n\n\nScenario 2: Another man who I had just met heard me mention that our longterm plan (me and my boyfriend) is to return to my home country in the next 5 years to be closer to my family. He then told me a different version of the same thing: that I wouldn't be able to work in the film industry OF MY OWN COUNTRY IN MY OWN LANGUAGE because it would be too competitive so I should have a backup plan - um, it's competitive sure, but you have never seen my work, and you have never worked with me, so why are you telling me I cannot compete? Also, I've never worked full-time in another industry, does he actually believe it's easier to do a complete pivot in your 30s when you already have a stable career to something completely new?   \n\n\nScenario 3: during covid, the various departments in our industry and set some maximum working hours for worker safety (before that there were no protections, you could shoot for 30 hours straight with no break and clients would just pay 1 day rate no OT) it was a big win for all of us. I was quite vocal in these meetings, about how important it is for us to walk off set after X amount of hours to hold productions accountable and NOT take triple OT instead - this is for worker safety not for money. A guy in the meeting who I have never worked with before (French/European) told me he gets it because the reason  we need these new rules is there are more women in my department from before and obviously we can't handle the long working hours like the men can so that's why we have his support.   \n\n\nThese are just recent work related scenarios, but the thing that strikes me is that the men that I work with day to day don't question me at all - they are 100% on my team and respect my leadership. But random ass men I meet on any given day are willing to discount 10 years of hard work to one way or another call me weak or incapable. It is ridiculous and I honestly feel attacked. "

He was going to the gym during our relationship, and it evidently did nothing to help him with his issues. He said Andrew Tate inspired him to believe in himself.

They break the whole group (roughly 40 people... also, it should be noted that I'm the only girl there) up into two teams, and you're on the same team throughout the day. They play different scenarios with different objectives, and each scenario lasts between 20-40 minutes. I was crawling around in the underbrush and dirt and shooting dudes in the ass with the best of them and having a blast. \n\nSo here's where the rant part starts. As we were standing around getting instructions for the next scenario from the dude who was running everything, he asks for three volunteers from each team. Carl looks at me and says that we're totally volunteering and I'm all right on let's do this. So we step into the clearing. Dude giving instructions looks at me briefly (for the record, I'm 5'10 and 135lbs, but I lift weights and my arms [which were the only part of my body not covered by gear/stuff] are actually pretty impressive, if I do say so myself) then looks at Carl and says \"Carl, you probably shouldn't let your wife do this part.\" Carl looked back at me because he knows me and he knew that this comment would likely not garner a positive response from me. It didn't. Carl looks back at the dude and goes \"she's not my wife, man\" and I interject with \"and why exactly shouldn't I be ALLOWED to do this part?\" The dude looks at me, obviously not super comfortable, and says \"it's just really hard and you'll be getting shot at a lot.\" I respond with \"And you don't think my delicate, female sensibilities could handle it?\" He just sort of says that it's just really hard again but moves on, and I stay exactly where I am and remain with the volunteers. \n\nThat's not all. \n\nAs we (the group of volunteers) make it to the opening where we're supposed to set up for the scenario we notice that there's an extra guy. Carl looks at him and says \"hey dude, we've already got our six. what are you doing here?\" and I shit you not, the guy responds with \"now we have six MEN.\" I lost. my. shit. I took two steps toward him and said \"are you fucking KIDDING ME right now??\" and I would likely have said more if Carl hadn't grabbed me and the dude in charge hadn't walked up and started telling us what we were supposed to do. \n\nSo here's the sigh part. \n\nI feel like I could have had a potentially positive impact on these guys if I had not lost my temper and been able to calmly explain why/how they were being asshats. I'm really annoyed with myself for the way I reacted, and I'm trying to go over how I could have handled it better. I think I was just shocked. \n\nThank you for listening.

    "body": "Because this is the kind of information I wish I'd had going in! Not that I didn't read my fair share of forum posts, but the more there are to read, the better in my opinion. Here's my lengthy experience! Some background: I'm almost 30, I've been on the pill since 14, and I've used so many kinds I can't remember them all. I'm sexually active with my 3+ years boyfriend and have no real interest in having kids at the moment (nor do I have any). I can't afford real health insurance and am being assisted by the state (for which I will be forever grateful, truly). However, the state would only cover the generic birth control pills, and I have had issues with generics and so I preferred my Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo. The cost was $90 per month and being raised to $120 per month. For reference, that's three times the cost of my phone bill. Yikes. I go to Planned Parenthood for my everything-associated-with-being-a-woman and they suggested I get an IUD (I had started asking whether or not taking hormone pills for 15 years is good for the body. This led to the discussion of Paragard). The state would completely cover the cost of the insertion, and that meant 10 years of not having to pay for birth control. What! Sign me up. So ok. Commence a lengthy period of research about the IUD. I read the pamphlets, I read the reviews online, I read the news articles, I talked to my Nurse Practitioner at PP at least two more times, I had a private conversation with my sister (a Mirena-hater for life, now) and my good friend (a lover of her Paragard IUD). I'm thorough, but once I made my decision I did not look back. It was the right choice for me. I mentally prepared myself as much as I could, because I had read some horror stories, but I tried to remember that people only post online for terrible things, so things are skewed. How bad could it be? I made my appointment for a Friday afternoon because I knew it would take a day or two for recovery. I took 800mg of Motrin, arrived early and listened to my meditation app for a few minutes to quiet myself. I had brought a pad because I knew to expect bleeding (no tampons for the first month, either!). I even brought pop-tarts because I have what is known as vasovagal syncope -- I have been known to completely pass out in situations that my brain finds high-anxiety (for me this is any time my blood is involved [except my period], such as a blood draw at a doctor's office, or if I accidentally cut myself). Sugar helps afterwards. I was taken to one of the clinic rooms and had to undress and put on the gown. People forget that you have to wait in that room and to me the wait is agonizing. When the NP finally came in, with a nurse to assist, I felt a little better. I asked her to please talk to me during the procedure (I wanted the distraction). I really just meant to have a casual conversation about like, the weather, but instead she told me what she was doing every step of the way. I wish I could remember it for you, but, well.. Firstly, yes, I was on my period when I went to have it done. They recommend that so that you're already a little open and it's easiest to get in. So that's a little awkward. They have to use a speculum, of course, which I never find pleasant but am used to from the PAPs. She had to measure my uterus to make sure it would fit (for some, the uterus isn't large enough). That is not a comfortable experience, since something has to be inserted up in there to gauge the length. At this point I remember getting quite light-headed but trying to focus on the conversation I was having with the nurse. I was then told that she was going to insert it, which required (slight) dilation of the cervix. I would love to tell you I handled this with dignity, grace, and composure but that would be a lie. I anticipated pain; I did not anticipate this level of pain (maybe not excruciating, because I endured it, but darn close!) coupled with how uncomfortable it made me feel both physically and mentally (there is something not quite right about things going IN there, as opposed to OUT of it). I remember repeating \"I don't feel good, I don't feel good\" over and over; I remember the NP asking me to be more specific. \"Stay with me, what doesn't feel good?\" And then I remember swimming back up to consciousness, finding two women pressing me down to the table with their forearms; apparently, I had passed out and begun seizing on the table. It sounds more traumatic than it was, because I've passed out and seized before. It was just a vasovagal response and I am known to have them. The rest is kind of a blur. The NP informed me that she had just finished inserting it before I passed out, so at least it was in. The nurse was straightening a lamp that I had kicked when I was unconscious, and she was handing me tissues because I was crying (I don't remember having started to cry), I was shaking from cold (my blood pressure dropped), the NP still had to get the speculum out of me (I'm told I was fortunate that I didn't hurt myself!). She had me put my legs back up so she could go in and trim the strings before she could remove it. Bless the NP who kept telling me that I was fine, this was fairly normal, I was just fine, everything was all right, I shouldn't be embarrassed. She left me with..."

I wanted to heal and grieve for what I lost and the person and puppy I lost on myself.\n\nI can't say for sure why I felt that way, I just knew I had to do it for myself.\n\nMy point here is that whatever you are going through, you can do it. You can get through it and you can do it yourself. Lean on others when you need to and when you can. But don't sell yourself short.  You are amazing and through pain and change comes beauty.\n\nSo I did. And while it's only been two months, I can saying doing that, I am happy. I'm grateful for feeling those emotions and that I was able to get myself to genuine laughter and happiness.\n\nI'm grateful it happened because I found my strength.\n\nI still have days where I am very angry with him.

At the time, I never really noticed that it was anything like that until she later contacted me on Facebook. Anyway long sorry short she began talking to me in a sexually charged way and sent me pictures and things and I reciprocated. Now, I’ve been struggling with porn addiction for a while and even back then, so it never really seemed that bad at the time. Heck, Most guys would high give me or something for that, but in reality it actually added to the severity of it all, that was the first (if you like) sexual experience I had with another person. I realised when I got older the kind of influence she had, when I started to notice that I had that same influence on the younger kids around me at church and similar things, it was then that I started to see how messed up it was to use that influence to pursue a sexual relationship with a child. \n\nI’ve never really felt the need to report her. She cut things off, which broke me at the time, but she seemed to regret what she did. \n\nIt’s not something that I ever talk about so I thought I’d just share. "

Because it's about not needing a man to be happy?!\" (Insert more hysterical laughing). He made a disapproving, scrunched face as I very obviously laughed at him in front of his friends. I laughed but I remember feeling kinda angry thinking to myself like wow. Is this what the world has come to. Women can't even be empowered by a song without it being considered woke??? Woman's struggles have been around longer than the term woke has even been said but nice to know it's being lumped in with the \"radical liberal agenda\". As if it's something so unfathomable.

    "body": "I suppose it isn't really a surprise that this happened. Her birth was the perfect recipe for disaster. First off, my baby sister is adopted. One day, her biological mother just came into my mother's office, unceremoniously plopped a baby carrier onto a desk and asked the people there if they wanted a baby. None of them wanted the baby, but then my father walked in, took one look at the baby and decided to bring her home. \n\nEveryone in the family knew, but I suppose there's some kind of stigma in being adopted (I don't get it myself) somehow somewhere it was decided that we wouldn't tell her. -I suppose that was mistake number one or was it. I have no idea. \n\nshe was a good kid growing up. A little bit of a quick temper but nothing that really stood out. I was around 13 years old and she was 3 when my father left to work overseas (it's been 15 years since I've last seen him) we talk on the phone every few weeks but he's never been much of a talker and never been much for displays of affection.. so I guess she never had a father figure- that probably makes it factor no. 2.. \n\nthen in 6th grade something changed. Suddenly she was cutting school and drinking with older boys. 12... 12 years old... it was such a sudden shift, I didn't know what to make of it. One reason I think (I only learned this years after the fact) was her varsity volleyball coach- who got a little bit handsy. He tried to kiss her and get her to do things.. (I never knew what else happened since she just stopped talking) so this might be factor number 3.\n\nwhen she was 14 she came out as a bisexual- and our entire family is hardcore catholic... so I guess that's factor number 4\n\nSo to recap, she somehow found out she's adopted, then hits puberty, got molested by her volleyball coach, found out she was bisexual- in a family that doesn't really care for it.. poor kid never stood a chance. \n\nAfter that (sixth grade), it has been a parade of trouble. Cutting classes, talking back to the teacher. Drinking. petty theft.. in 4 years she's been to 5 different schools in two different cities. She's been cutting herself and often times I've seen her suffer from rage episodes where she just punches herself or the wall.. \n\nnow, I've been advocating counseling/rehab for the past few years now. Trouble is, my mom doesn't want the trouble, my dad doesn't believe in counseling and won't pay for it. That leaves my older sister (who is crazy in love with a guy in new york - nothing else exists outside of her quest to be united with her love) and me (currently jobless, depressed and currently in another city) \n\nI kind of get how she feels like her druggy friends are the only ones who can understand her, we're in the front page of 'family issues magazine'.. I feel like I'm the only one who cares anymore. Everybody else is treating her like she's a bad person, that she was born that way *whispers 'cause she's adopted'\n\nshe's stopped listening to me. She has tuned everybody else out and one of these days, I'm afraid she's going to do something monumentally stupid that could land her in jail or worse in the morgue. \n\nTL/DR but honestly I have no idea what I'm gonna do. no one else is taking this seriously. \n\n"

    "body": "Sophomore year of college, I had expressed to my professor who was my advisor at the time that I had felt as though I was being stalked. I told him that this student who had nowhere near the same schedule as I did seemed to be following me in between my classes. It made no sense, since I knew this student was in a different college than I was. I mentioned that whenever this guy saw me, he would approach me and try to talk to me. He would get much too close to comfort while talking, and he always gave me the creeps because he would ask personal questions and try to be touchy. I had turned him down before, said no to his requests for my number and I would duck out of whatever building I was in just to escape him before he noticed me because I was so uncomfortable. If he saw me and began pestering me, I would give as little information as possible because I knew if I gave him any information then he would 'coincidentally' turn up near me the next day. I'm pissed because I even had to give up going to the café for a few weeks because of this person. Even months after it subsided I would still scan places for him just in case. \n\nThere was even one time where I was at a party with my friends and he approached me, trying to dance close behind me. My two friends had to force him away from me and stand in front of me because he could not take the hint. They yelled at him over the music to stop, and we decided to leave to another party since he kept lurking around us. Guess what? He followed us there, too. \n\nSo, while telling my advisor about these experiences, he paused for a minute and listened thoughtfully. He told me I could be exaggerating, because sometimes, he said, I overstated my experiences. He asked me if I wanted to take it up with Title IX, and I said no because I had heard it would ding my record, too. I'm on a scholarship and first generation. I wasn't sure how the Title IX office worked, and it didn't seem as though my professor did either. I didn't want to do anything that would flag my dean's attention, especially since it sounded like I was just being paranoid.\n\nWell, today I found out that 6 charges are being pressed against this student because he has verbally, physically and sexually assaulted many females across campus. There are 6 charges, but more than 40 females have shared their stories about times they have made them feel uncomfortable. I had no idea I was not alone in feeling this way. I was right. I was not exaggerating. \n\nTonight I want to tell you that if you ever feel uncomfortable, you are not wrong. It is better to be safe than sorry. If someone else tells you that you shouldn't be uncomfortable or that you are unjustified in being uncomfortable, don't listen! You don't owe the person who is making you uncomfortable the time of day, nor do you owe an explanation of why you're uncomfortable to anyone else. It should not have had to take me 2 years and 40+ women with similar stories to feel secure in my own experiences. So double down on how you feel, because you could be right, too."

Luckily for me, the friendly guy came walking up moments later, asked for another cigarette and hung out with me for a few minutes til angry guy left.

We found out about a horrible gambling addiction he had for many years and, even after the family found out, he outright refused our help and refused to seek help on his own. Shortly after that, my mom revealed that he had sexually assaulted her as a teenager. It was at that point that nearly the entire family went no contact.\n\nMy mom called me this weekend to tell me that he died. All alone. He's apparently been in and out of hospital since August and asked that none of the family know about it. It sounds like the reasons he was in hospital were because he was neglecting his own health. Part of me wonders if he just wanted to die and chose to do it alone.\n\nI haven't thought about him much since I went NC, but hearing this news has caused a whole flood of emotions. Anger about what he did to my mom and my family. More anger and confusion directed at my mom because she would let me sleep over at my grandparents' when I was a kid, when no one knew about the sexual assault except her. Did she not think that he might do something to me too? Nothing ever did happen, but I can't help but wonder what she thought about when saying yes to my brother and I having sleepovers at my grandparents' house.\n\nAnd most of all, I can't shake this feeling of sadness. The sadness that I've lost my grandpa. Because even though he fucked up. Bad. I still had nearly 20 years with him as my grandpa. He never did anything to harm me personally. And I just can't shake the thought of him dying in a hospital bed all by himself. Maybe be wanted it that way. But I can't help but feel so horrible because I don't feel like anyone should die completely alone like that.\n\nI can't make sense of my feelings. Do I miss him?

We went for dinner and I dropped him home afterwards, and we kept on talking and meeting up as time went by. I made it very clear that I was looking for something serious and didn’t just sleep around and he agreed.\n\nAfter about two weeks of casual dates, he invites me to his place where one thing led to another etc and we finally sleep together for the first time. At this point everything was still fine and I was seeing him regularly, but I noticed he stopped asking me to go out on dates and just wanted me to come over and sleep with him all the time.\n\nWe had a fight about a month into dating (it was getting a little serious with us) because he cancelled on me again after he asked me to plan a night out. At that point (he had lied to me), I decided to delete his number and forget about it, which I did, and so we didn’t speak until around two weeks/10 days later. He reached back out to me BY SENDING ME A TIKTOK. Eventually we start talking again.\n\nHe didn’t understand why I was angry, said he really liked me and wanted to talk about things, that he missed me and deleted dating apps etc… so I went over to his house to see him. We had a conversation and made up but then I asked a question that, in hindsight I should not have asked; if he had slept with anyone while we were not talking and he said yes. I was a bit annoyed at that (I appreciate I was in the wrong here because we weren’t talking) but we had another argument again about it, because he thought I was joking around about being annoyed and was surprised I didn’t sleep with anyone.\n\nAnyway, this argument resulted in him saying he didn’t know what he wanted and that it was too fresh between us, fair enough. I decided I needed time to think about whether or not this was worth pursuing as I already felt like I went too far with him. So I started avoiding him and he went on a two week trip abroad.\n\nWhile he was abroad, I asked him not to message me. I explained that if he wanted to go abroad and sleep with other women etc, it would be fine as we weren’t dating but I didn’t want him to call or text me during this time because I knew I would get hurt if I found out he did sleep with people later down the line.\n\nHe said no worries, I’ll message you when I am back which I was fine with. At this point I was withdrawing myself from the situation anyway because I felt like he was using me. But a week before he actually came back he started messaging me again, more regularly than before, responding to me quickly and asking about me etc. i thought maybe he was finally taking me seriously and got very excited for him to come back. A day before he comes back he asks me to go see him over the weekend.\n\nAll of a sudden, after having texted me just a few hours before that he landed, goodnight and see you soon etc, he sends me a paragraph saying he isn’t looking for anything serious and sorry if he has lead me on, that he has a lot of work to do on himself.\n\nI’m not stupid and i have had this from men before. A lot of them try to get me emotionally invested to sleep with me, and then throw me away.\n\nI’m just confused why, after I asked him to leave me alone twice, he kept prying to come back only to decide he didn’t really want me.

This is something he had done previously (his parents had an empty apartment he was able to use) so I knew that had probably been his intention but I had had enough with the relationship. He hasn't earned any sort of income for a decade, so money was tight. He is very critical of my parenting but hardly did a thing to help with the kids or around the house and constantly wanted money. He is a great cook so would help with meals, but only if he had the exact ingredients he wanted, often these were very expensive.\n\nThe final straw really was that he became convinced I was having an affair when I was at work (I work from home) and would come and sit behind me while I tried to work, staring at the computer screen and talking constantly. It was incredibly difficult to work like this.\n\nI definitely have my faults too and I put up with a lot of this because I assumed I was equally annoying or inconsiderate and that we have to make concessions, but being accuse of cheating was the end for me. And since he left, life has been a lot easier - even with three kids. I don't feel anxious all the time.\n\nProblem is, now he cannot stay in the apartment anymore and while he actually has the option of a free flat with some work attached, he doesn't like the location - it's 15 km from us which he thinks is 'too far'. He's dropping hints about moving in again and using the kids as a reason. He says they have suffered with him gone and I am bringing them up very badly, with too little discipline. I really don't want him back at all but I am wondering whether this is a selfish perspective and whether it would be better to tolerate his behaviour in order to let the kids grow up with two parents. (The oldest child says they don't want him back at all, the other two are too young to ask, really).\n\nI know he will struggle on his own, but I also feel he had several months to find work/accommodation and so he doesn't \\*have\\* to be homeless... but suspect he could end up that way.. He is very proud and has been out of work for so long because no job is good enough. He also won\\\\t claim benefits because he is too proud to do so\n\nI currently feel under constant pressure to offer him a place to stay. I feel like not to could be a selfish decision and could adversely impact him, but I am really much happier without him. The guilt is horrible."

Every time I switch birth control I've gained about 15-20 pounds in a few months and have a very very difficult time losing that weight. First I tried multiple types of pills but I forgot to take those often. \n\nAbout ten months ago I switched to Nexaplon, which is the little implant that goes in your arm and lasts for three years. I've had no bad side effects like I used to get (I.e. Migraines, mood swings, loss of libido) except I gained 20 pounds again! This is such a hard thing for me because I really struggle with body image issues and now I'm 180 ponds with a frame that is at a healthy weight around 135-140. \n\nSince starting birth control almost four years ago I've been at least 150 pounds. Basically I'm wondering if any of you have experienced a similar issue and if you have any suggestions for how to combat this side effect. Any help is appreciated! "

I consider myself pro-choice. She said some confusing and upsetting things about how she can no longer consider herself pro-choice because that equates to pro-abortion. Her comments honestly did make me think and I would like to do more reading on the matter but am nervous about what kind of google worm hole I'd end up in by googling abortion rights. Does anyone have reliable sources or even personal experiences they are willing to share? I wanted to refute a lot of her points but chose to say nothing at all because I didn't want to argue when I don't consider myself well read on the subject.\n\nSome of the things she said was:\n* All women feel terrible after an abortion, I know because all the women I've worked with (as a social worker) who have had an abortion regret it terribly and have depression around it.\n* The morning after pill should not be advertised at our former college campus because it IS abortion\n* An abortion is a serious medical procedure and regardless of ethics, it can totally mess up your internal organs and shouldn't be thought of as a simple, in and out procedure. It is invasive. \n* Abortion is frequently used as birth control in Canada, as it is free\n* It is offered way too quickly to anyone considering it and can be performed on under age girls without parent consent \n* Planned parenthood goes to poor foreign countries to sterilize women \n"

Things are great in the relationship when we are together and I don't have any complaints other than this one.\n\nMy bf is my age and is very money driven. He was fairly aggressive financially when he was younger, and made quite a bit. He's an engineer and has his own company, but he subcontracts himself to a large company and he is also one of the owners (or partners as they call it). He is by far more successful than any of his partners/friends (he only really interracts with the partners and considers them friends), because he is very frugal. He has an amazing place, everything in his penthouse is gorgeous. Other than that he appears very average. He is very physically fit and healthy, but he lives well below his means. He only has a few business suits (for meetings), but he dresses average. He drives a baseline used ford car, and he has a base ford truck (when he goes to the rigs to consult). He rarely spends money on anything, and never goes on trips. he pays himself (under his own personal name) once a year on Dec 21st for $41000 and that's it.\n\nThe above was to just give you a feel for him. My issue is that all his friends spoil their gf's or mistresses and they live large. They drive Audi's and go travelling and do amazing things. He doesn't do much of that. He takes me on the odd weekend trip here and there and pays for everything but it's never expensive. I asked him about marriage and he said he has no intention of ever getting married, because he wants no external factors affecting his financial progression. I've also asked about moving in together and he is against that either. He's told me many times that I have nothing to fear because he would never cheat or abandon me, and I believe him. He doesn't interract with people unless he knows money can be made, so I know he won't cheat because his time could be better used to make money. He's told me many times that the relationship will progress when I figure out what my goals are in life and when I start working towards them. I don't really know what he expects of me in that regard. \n\nAm I shallow for wanting to recieve gifts once in a while? I don't necessarily need an Audi, but my car is crappy and he could definitely help me out with a new one but he refuses. His friends all shower their women with gifts and vacations and I don't get any of those perks. His friends are also not faithful and there are other issues there I guess. Does anyone feel the same way? Is it wrong that I think this? Please give me some advice, because I don't know if I should just appreciate what I have and stay with him.\n"

So she's never swept, moped, cleaned the kitchen, cleaned the toilet/shower/bathroom, does dishes that she isn't sure she actually touched, she doesn't even throw away her food that's clearly rotting or regularly take out the trash. Anyway, we've had some conversations about it, but I just gave it up as a lost cause.\n\nFast forward to now, she sends me a message the other day that's \"Hey, I'm subleasing my room this summer.\" I'm surprised and ask to who, and she says she doesn't know, she'll just post an add on Craigslist. Oh.. okay. An ad only for girls, right? No, that'll \"cut her potential occupant pool in half\". Which statistically I get, but I'M the one that's expected to live with a stranger, and you won't even give me a say as to who that stranger is? I mean my bedroom door doesn't even lock. I also have a cat, so I'd appreciate her including \"pet friendly\" in her ad.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what the policy is with my apartment about subleasing to see if my consent is necessary. But I'm hesitant to say anything because my boyfriend's been staying with us for a couple weeks since he had a period between his lease ending and his new one starting. She agreed to this, and he's helping with bills for this time period. We almost exclusively stay in my bedroom and he's out of the apartment for work before she even gets up. I feel like arguing with her about a subleaser will result in her saying my boyfriend can't stay. I also have this irrational fear that upsetting her will result in her treating my cat badly. Or that the stranger subleaser will treat him badly.\n\nSo should I stick out the few weeks with him here and start the conversation when he's moved into his new place? I feel like I already tried to talk to her about my preferences in this situation and she dismissed them because in her mind it's \"her room\" which is true but I'm living here too and there's supposed to be trust between roommates."

    "body": "Just posting here because I’m fired up and looking for some support. I posted the below as a response to someone trying explain the anti vaccination movement’s bodily autonomy argument by pointing out that anti-choice advocates believe fetus’s are people. Their argument was that anti-choice advocates believe the fetus’s right to life supersedes a woman’s right to choose.\n\n“It’s not that they believe a fetus’s right to be alive supersedes the mother’s wishes, it’s that they believe the fetus’s right to be alive, before it has a heart mind you, supersedes the mother’s right to be alive. They believe that a pregnant woman is obligated to sacrifice her body and life for the potential of life, no mater what the consequences might be for her. If this were not true, they would have exceptions for things like rape, incest, viability and potential risk to the mother. \n\nThe United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the developed world, and it’s disproportionately higher for woman of color and women who live in poverty, the same people who will be disproportionately burdened by this law. \n\nHere is a real life example for you. My sister and her husband had been trying to get pregnant for 8 months and they finally conceived, yay! She took pregnancy tests constantly, basal temps, the whole thing. She is very well researched and careful. She found out she was pregnant at 4 weeks (like the earliest it’s possible to find out), but couldn’t get in to see a Dr until 6 weeks. Because her pregnancy is considered a geriatric pregnancy, her Dr recommend that she get all of the chromosomal tests. (Mind you, we’re already past the 6 week cut off Texas is imposing but bear with me.) She scheduled the earliest possible appointment she could (she is extremely proactive and diligent) and waited for the results. Well, the lab lost her samples, so she had to go get tested again. She got the results yesterday. She is now 15 weeks. She found out she’s a carrier for a chromosomal disease that if passed on would give the potential baby a max life expectancy of 2 years. So now her husband has to get tested (you need to get the gene from both parents because it’s recessive) but he can’t get in until Monday. Then, it takes 2-3 weeks for the test results to come back. THEN, if he ends up being a carrier (🤞🏽 that he doesn’t obviously, and it is unlikely so there’s that) they would have to do more extensive testing to determine the viability of the fetus. So now we’re talking like 20 plus weeks. \n\nThis better not fucking happen because everyone involved would be devistated, but if it turns out that my sister’s fetus is not viable or the child won’t live past the age of 2, she may not want to go through the pain of child birth just to turn around and go through the pain of loosing a child. I wouldn’t wish that fate on my worst, anti-choice enemy, and I am hoping with everything I have that my sister will not have to make that choice either.\n\nThis kind of stuff is so common. This isn’t a unique story. These are the real choices that woman are making. Abortion is complicated and personal and something we all hope we’ll never have to think about. \nSomeone who thinks a rapist’s 6 week old fetus is more valuable than the rape victim’s life doesn’t value life. Someone who thinks a woman should be forced to carry a beloved and wanted, yet unviable fetus to term, go through often dangerous and traumatic labor, only to then watch their child suffer and ultimately die does not value life. And furthermore, someone who refuses to protect themselves, their family, and their community from a deadly virus that has killed 658k Americans, devastated families, and forever altered all of our lives because the don’t want to get a safe, convenient, and free vaccine for no other reason than it “being their right” does not value life. \n\nSorry for the rant. I have feelings today.”"

I witnessed arguments on both sides, from people say it's just a shirt, that the fight over it isn't worth it to others declaring that it's everything wrong with scientific community today, that his decision to wear that shirt eclipsed everything he and his team accomplished. Admittedly, I thought it was a relatively minor incident, particularly when there are more salient examples of misogyny and men getting away with things (read: Bill Cosby, et al). There was one particular argument I witnessed in which some strident feminists declared that the horrifying reaction to the science journalist's tweet represents all men. That left me angry and confused because it doesn't represent all men, and if men are to be a part of the dialogue, we can't readily participate when we've already been written off. I don't mean to condescending. I only want to illustrate the frustration I feel as I try to figure out my place in the feminist dialogue.\n\nI've heard that being a feminist is as simple as believing both sexes should be equal, but then I've heard that isn't that simple, that it's something that has to be bestowed. I thought Emma Watson's speech was particularly empowering and insightful, but than I read criticism from other feminists saying that Emma Watson either missed the mark or only slightly hit it. So the framework Watson tried to establish was too weak or not right for certain groups of feminists, so my participating in that framework doesn't count for some.\n\nI don't know what it means to be a man and a feminist when there seems to be a number of competing ideas. How much is required of me? Am I supposed to raise hell every time I see an infraction? How much of this fight is mine, and how much of it is yours?\n\nI want to help. I just don't know how."

She seemed happy with that so that's not the conflict, just trying to paint a picture.\n\nSo, she talked...a lot...and she was very upbeat and positive and I enjoyed listening to her. But, then, she had made a comment about how important it was to her to see the good in everyone...no matter what. And, I kind of agreed, but mentioned that I couldn't really see the good in racists, bigots, etc.\n\nAt that point, I continued listening respectfully, but some of the things she said made me feel really sad. She said that she believes that there is nothing that can be done about racists as America was founded by white men, for white men. She said that Black people were supposed to be sent back to Africa but Africa didn't want them back so they are basically stuck here. She believes the best result that can be hoped for is that we all just learn to co-exist.\n\nHer sons are both married to white women and told her that Black men don't want to be in serious relationships or marry Black women and if they are with one, they're settling. She took this as acceptable. She is thankful that their wives \"cleaned\" them up and got them to start wearing pants that fit and helped them get good jobs. Not that that in and of itself is bad, but she even said that these women got her sons to stop acting like thugs which just made me feel off for some reason.\n\nI guess, I feel really sad that she just accepts that racism is a thing and I feel like I maybe should have argued about it, but as a white woman it feels wrong to argue with a Black woman about racism. I really like her, but I just have this feeling of sadness that hasn't gone away yet even though this happened about 4 hours ago.\n\nI'll probably run into her again at some point. Is there anything I could or should say? Or just listening and being supportive even though the idea that we should just accept bigotry of any kind and see the best in all people no matter what really rubs me the wrong way. I was tempted to say, \"Wait, what about rapists and child molesters,\" but was afraid that I wouldn't like the answer.\n\nAny advice or ideas would be most welcome.  No matter what, I will always be as kind and supportive as I can, but I feel like maybe there is something helpful I could say to make her see that she doesn't need to accept racism as something, I don't know, inevitable?\n\nI hope it's ok I posted this here. This sub feels like the most supportive of all the subs I read and I feel like I'll likely get the best advice here. \n\nThanks for listening!"

I have a follow up appointment in 3 days.\n\nAt the moment I am still quite swollen, both minora and majora, there is very little bleeding, occasionally a small amount after urinating and drying myself, some itchiness but barely any pain. My main concern is what seems to puss seeping from the areas that were trimmed.\nBeing such a precious area I am not sure if I am over reacting or if this is a sign of infection and that I should get to my surgeon earlier than already booked.\nI am also curious as to whether I should be showering yet as some testimonials I have read say that they were showering a day after surgery, whereas others recommend not until 10 days! I showered yesterday but the amount of puss has increased since then.\nI am currently taking Diclofenacnatrium and Paracetamol for the pain."

    "body": "Hey everybody, I’m very angry and need to vent because my boyfriend just doesn’t get it and thinks I’m “overreacting” about the whole situation. \n\nI moved in with my boyfriend a year ago and brought my 3yo cat with me. She has always been prone to urinary crystals and has had major issues with this in the past. However, since starting her up on a specialized cat food for urinary issues and also adding water to all her meals, she’s had no further problems. \n\nUp until recently, I was 100% responsible for all her care and was following this diet dilligently, but I ended up having to go away for 2 months due to school. My boyfriend took over her care. Before I left, I made sure to remind my boyfriend about her diet (and it’s not even that complicated…just a scoop of dry food and some water), and he agreed with no questions.\n\nI came back home this past Monday, and everything seemed fine, but Tuesday morning my cat grabbed my attention by peeing blood on the floor in front of me. I immediately took her to the vet and was told she had crystals again.\n\nI phoned my boyfriend, upset, because I didn’t know what else I could do for her anymore, and thats when he admitted to me that he hadn’t been following her diet. He had just been giving her straight kibble with no water in it the whole time I was away. I asked him why he hadn’t listen to me and he told me he “didn’t think he needed to do all that” and that he “thought everything I was doing was overkill”. He then told me “she’s prone to crystals, we don’t know if what I did caused it”. I was so mad. I told him “yeah, we don’t know because you didn’t listen to me”, and he immediately said I was overreacting and sarcastically apologized for “fucking up one thing”. \n\nI’m still so mad. He doesn’t understand how deeply hurt I am…where does he get off thinking he knows better about my cat’s care than me? How am I supposed to trust him with anything…raise a family with him, if he treats my concerns so flippantly and dismisses them? Why doesn’t he understand that its not the fact that he didn’t fucking put water in my cats food, but all the thought processes leading up to that action that are making me upset? Idk, I can’t even look at him right now and I’m questioning everything about our relationship, as dumb as that sounds."

What the fuck (Edit: I hardly know the guy besides as classmates, we went partying 3 times in group settings)\n\nUpdate 2: I talked to a girlfriend we have in common. She will break ties with him as well, as she heard that this happened once before to another classmate of ours. Question for you all, the guy left expensive alcohol and tupperware at my place.

    "body": "I’ll try to write out everything as clear and concise as I can, so I do apologize if there’s any errors or confusion along the way. Writing isn’t my strongest suit. \n\nLast week is when I started noticing something was off. After grabbing a bite to eat from the campus cafe, I went to the library to see if there were any private study cubicles to study at. When I couldn’t find any, I decided to head off to another section of the campus and noticed a guy following behind me. I didn’t think anything of it at first, because of course it’s a campus with thousands of students looking for a place to study — but then when I continued along to other parts of the campus looking for a quiet study space he was still behind me. I went back to the library (and yes he was still following) and found a cubicle. Anytime I’d look around the corner from my cubicle I could see him walking around the bookshelves near me and that’s when I really started to get weirded out — he just didn’t stop walking around the whole entire time. Eventually, when I was packing up and getting ready to leave he stopped and said hi to me and I said hi back and left quickly making sure he wasn’t following behind me anymore. \n\nWhich brings us to today. After finishing my last class of the day, I quickly got a bottled drink from my school’s cafe and he saw me and followed me in there!? I quickly finished paying and went to the washroom to see if he’d follow me again (this was really dumb on my part I know).  I waited it out for five minutes, and when I decided to exit the bathroom he was there, but then left right after he saw me exit the washroom. After making such a dumb decision I decided to go to a more open public space, the library and to see if he left for good and get some study time in. But no he was there again. Still wandering up and down the library and around the shelves where I was sitting. \n\nWhen I finally got uncomfortable and got ready to leave he said hi again, and asked how I was. I quickly said hi back and brushed him off coldly. And once I started walking towards the exit of the library he was hot on my trail again. I didn’t want him to follow me home, so I just turned around and asked if I could help him with anything. He then started to ask basic questions like what program I was in, my name, what semester I was in, if I spent a lot of time in the library, what my program was about, and I was just feeling so anxious that I basically lied and told him fake answers, and that I had to go and that my boyfriend was waiting for me. \n\nAnd now after calming down, I remembered he said he's apart of a program that’s for student’s who have learning challenges, disabilities and who are learning to interact with the real world. I feel sort of like an asshole for jumping to conclusions, that he was a creep, but he might just be socially awkward and doesn’t know how to interact with other people? \n\nI still feel nervous about returning to campus tomorrow and I don’t want him to follow me around anymore and he made me feel uncomfortable. I don’t know am I just overreacting?  \n\nSide Note: Not sure how important this is, but when I brought up my boyfriend was waiting for me, he cut the conversation short, so?"

(He must have gotten my number from the reservation system I used to book the table.) He politely asked if he could add a 20% tip in case it was a mistake. I apologized and said to add the tip, but I feel like this was weirdly out of bounds. I would have much preferred to be contacted by the management, or even the host.\n\nSide note: he made several uncomfortable sexual jokes to a table full of women and all of us felt uncomfortable with his service, so the fact that he got my number makes me even more bothered. I feel like I want to contact management and say something, but that would just be to make myself feel better, so I probably won’t. \n\nWould this bother you too, or am I taking it too seriously?\n\n\nUPDATE: So I contacted management with something very similar to what I've originally posted here, and the female manager just got back to me. She was actually more outraged than I was. Apparently, this guy is in training and she expressed major concern for his judgment based on this feedback. She said they never would have reached out at all regarding tipping, let alone allowed the server to do it himself. She apologized profusely, and said that I \"won't be seeing him again\" and to contact her before my next visit. Although many of you are right that this is unlikely to be an isolated incident, I feel pretty awful for being the reason someone is let go. I'm also concerned that if he is terminated, he has my phone and likely my email - so I've blocked his number."

Of course, I've felt insecure about my appearance, but I've never felt the need to surgically alter myself. At these clinics, I was told that my eyes looked \"sleepy\" and that my eyes would look more \"alert,\" and honestly, I've never analyzed myself to that degree. I'm so sick of these extreme beauty standards in Asia and my family's attempts to impose them on me without any respect for my thoughts. I'm really kicking myself for not being more firm, for not even making a scene at the clinic so that my family wouldn't even mention double eyelid surgery. But now I have to deal with the consequences of my(?) decision and I just don't know what to do with myself. My eyes won't settle into their final shape until 6 months later. As of now, my eyelids are kinda swollen looking and I can't seem to get myself out of my depressed state of mine.

    "body": "I tried posting this on twitter with the #metoo hashtag but honestly, it's being used so much nobody will probably ever read it there. My boyfriend suggested I post my story here instead.  I was at a birthday party at a friends place. I'd just turned 16 about a week or so before. I had to sleep over at her place. At the party, there was this middle eastern guy that was about 20 or so. He was being flirty and talked to me a lot, but I had no interest in him. That night I got really drunk. Birthday girl and some other person slept in her room. I had to sleep on the couch in the living room. The couch was this long one with a corner in the middle, so two people could sleep there without touching eachother. The middle eastern guy had to sleep on the other side of the couch. When we went to bed, there was no one else in the room besides me and him. The guy started touching me and tried to kiss me. He opened my shirt and started pulling off my pants.  I'd never been with anyone before. I was a virgin.  I told him no. He'd answer with something like \"come on..\" and then pulled them off anyways. I was scared and drunk. I didn't know what to do. I was mentally aware but felt cognitively slow (if that makes sense). The guy pushed me down and forced himself inside of me. It's one of the most painful experiences i've ever had - I wasn't wet at all and never wanted this. I remember staring at my knee that would slam against the side of the couch, maybe in an attempt to put my mind on something else other than what was happening. I was embarrassed about the sound. I didn't want anyone to think I was having sex so I put my hand under my knee to soften the sound so nobody would hear. I didn't want anyone to know. The guy finished inside of me. Multiple times throughout the night, he'd come over to try to touch me again. I wrapped my blanket tightly around me and wouldn't let him touch me again. I stayed awake the whole night in case he'd come back. I was just waiting for it to be morning, so I could go home. The next morning, my mom picked me up. I asked my mom if she could get me a morning-after pill. She didn't really ask questions, just took me to the pharmacy to get one. I guess she didn't want to bother me with it in case I was embarrassed, and honestly I wasn't ready to tell her either. I didn't tell anyone about the experience, not the birthday girl, the parents of the birthday girl, or anyone in my family for a while. I blamed myself. I thought it was my own fault. Why didn't I fight back or scream or anything? All I did was say no and then just lie there. At the time, I didn't think this was rape. I thought this was how sex was supposed to be. I'd have nightmares about it almost every night. I'd toss and turn in bed. I had many sleepless nights and I cried a lot. I was scared of having sex ever again.  Half a year later, I went to Copenhagen with my sister. I'm a lot younger than my siblings. They kind of 'felt too grown-up' for me to tell them about something like this. Me and my sister shared bed and I'd still have these nightmares. I'd be restless and move around in the bed. My sister thought it was annoying and told me to stop. I didn't really know how to feel, being yelled at for it, but I knew I couldn't just stop it, so I decided to tell my sister how I had this terrible sexual experience and the memory wouldn't go away. She asked me if I was lying. I've never lied to her. It definitely wasn't what I needed to hear as the first thing - with her being the first person I opened up to. I broke down crying and ran to the toilet and sat in there. She came out there and explained to me that it sounded more like rape. I guess it was hard for her to believe? We talked about it for a bit. She told me I absolutely wasn't at fault and I should stop blaming myself. Realising that actually felt relieving in a way. I was blaming myself for the experience but I shouldn't. I wasn't at fault. I was a very young girl, drunk and I'd said no. He forced himself onto me. He did something wrong.  A year later, I finally got the courage to tell my mom. It's been 7 years now and I've never told my dad. I can't get myself to tell him, but I also feel like maybe he deserves to know. He's always been an amazing dad.  I tried having sex a few times afterwards. It wasn't good at all. I couldn't relax. It wasn't intimate. I was just lying there and felt nothing. Must've been a lame experience for the guys as well, cause I felt pretty dead inside while it was going on. It wasn't until I met my first real boyfriend 3 years later I realised how it's supposed to be and feel - when someone is patient and gentle with you.  I never reported the guy. I never asked my friend for his name. I don't even want to know his name. I just want to forget. I did ask my friend if she still hangs out with him. Maybe I would've told her about it if she'd said yes, but she said she hadn't talked to him since the party. That was good enough for..."

The walking on egg shells, made to feel like I was losing my mind, the rug would once in a while be pulled from under me, all because he was utterly non-confrontational to the point where our relationship was \"good vibes only\". \n\nNow anytime I see those words I want to fly into a rage. I taste the bitter and cancerous taste of it in my mouth. All the frustration, the anger, the grief, the inability to stand up for myself (wasn't allowed to) bubbles up like Vesuvius looking for Pompeii. On paper, he never did anything *wrong.* He checked all the boxes and lit up my world. We traveled the earth together, exploring and adventuring. We were building an incredible life together. Until facades started to crack. And I woke up one day realizing that he may never had laid a hand on me but he crushed my spirit and destroyed my self esteem instead. One tiny subtle little bit at a time. \n\nNow I've been spending years putting back the pieces of myself. And staying away from any and all who cannot handle confrontation. I want to tell all of them that life is about confrontation. You confront your demons, you face your hell, you challenge yourself, otherwise *you do not grow.* I don't handle confrontation well (who does?). I shake with it. I have to chew it over and over in my mind, on paper, practice and then proceed. But it needs to happen. Sometimes I want to face him and calmly tell him - I am not a coward. *But you are.*  However I am sticking to my last missive to him. That I hope never to see or hear from him again for as long as I live. \n\nAnd I keep thinking. I am not the only woman to go through this. I am not the only one not allowed to be upset, to be angry, to be frustrated. I am not allowed to be a full human, a full person. I am so done with that. Those \"good vibes only\" trope can go shove it."

So I asked her what it was.\n\n\nIt was a story about the protests Australia is having after the fallout of the Brittney Higgins confession. My mother is offended that these women are openly discussing rape and sexual assault. \n\n\nI'm 35 and spent 2 years being raped regularly by a boyfriend because I was brought up to believe that's what relationships were. \n\n\nI said to her that maybe if rape was more openly discussed i wouldn't have been raped for 2 years. This is something she didn't know about. She changed the subject.

I distinctly remember giving my biggest smile to strangers when we went out for walks, and they always smiled back. I remember it felt nice to have a stranger smile back at me. But nowadays I actively try to keep a serious face while I'm walking down the street.\nSo, the other day I was wondering when I stopped smiling at people and why. When did I start to make an effort not to smile? Maybe I should try smiling again. And then it hit me. I don't know exactly when I stopped but I guess it was around the same time (and the same reason why) I started to get hesitant to say good morning to strangers on the street. I didn't want they to think I was leading them on. I didn't want men tho think I was leading them on. So I learned to ignore everyone and look mad as I walk down the street - so I wouldn't be carltcalled or stared at too much. \nAs I grew up I noticed more and more men staring at me. I even remember when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up at school and a van full of 40-something men stopped at the red sign and shamelessly stared at 15-year-old me. It made me uncomfortable enough that I decided to get out of there. Normal-child me would have smiled and waved. But that didn't even cross my mind at the time. I was embarrassed, uncomfortable and afraid. And that happened directly in front of my school.\nI'm sorry for the rambling I just got really upset that I can't smile to strangers anymore."

    "title": "I reported my PhD advisor for harassment and nearly lost my graduate career over it. Informal AMA inside.",
    "body": "Throwaway here, otherwise regular reader of TwoX.\n\nI am a PhD student at a major public research university. My (now former) PhD advisor had an extramarital relationship with an undergrad who was paid to work in our lab and given many special privileges as a result of her relationship with the professor. When I let the undergrad (someone I considered a friend) know that I was aware of their relationship out of concern for her, the professor began a campaign of retaliation that eventually drove me out of the lab and led me to reporting the way he was treating me and his relationship to the department head. He also repeatedly sexually harassed other female members of the lab. I was effectively removed from the department after making this report.\n\nSexual assault between students is very prominent in the national spotlight right now, but I believe the focus on the undergrad assault problem has allowed some universities to turn a blind eye to the fact that their own professors can be guilty of sexual misconduct as well. When professors engage in sexual misconduct it can cut a wide path of destruction, even when a physical assault hasn't happened. This professor's actions ultimately cost him his job, close to a million dollars in grant money (all returned to funding institutions), 2 grad students were left without labs, 2 grad students were fortunate enough to be able to graduate early, 1 lab manager was unemployed, and 8 undergrads were left without a lab.\n\nI am now working within my university to try and improve reporting and investigation procedures and to find protections for STEM graduate students who live and die by their advisors so that grad students don't have to choose between reporting misconduct and potentially ruining their own careers to do so or just dealing with a hostile environment.\n\nSo AMA about what it was like going through the (now 2 year long) process, what I'm doing about it now, or about being a female graduate student in biomedical science. Or ask me something random. I was going to write up the whole story of what happened as a sort of catharsis, but I figured it might be more useful to others who might have questions about what happens in similar situations to try it this way.\n\n*I'd be happy to verify details with mods.\n\n**Detail edit:** I did not arbitrarily decide that this relationship constituted some sort of sexual misconduct based on offending my delicate sensibilities- our university defines any person in a supervisory or managerial role (teaching, employment, or mentorship) that has a relationship with a subordinate to be engaging in misconduct. \n\nI also did not report the relationship on purpose. I tried to report the harassment and discrimination I witnessed and received, but in my meeting with the department head I made an offhand comment about his relationship with the undergrad. You see, the professor had told other grad students that he had disclosed the relationship and my comment to the DH was something about being surprised that they didn't care more about it. Turned out they cared a lot about it and my comment was the first time they were hearing about it because the professor lied about having disclosed it. So I did not get jealous and scorned and tattle about a relationship, I accidentally reported that part.\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nNight time edit: I'd like to thank people who asked questions, supportive or in opposition to my actions. I don't know if I did the right thing. I appreciate the discussion and the opportunity to talk about what happened.\n\nI am a little disappointed in the minority response that I am a life ruiner. This is why people don't speak up when they're in actual hostile work environments. What I did was talk about things that this guy *actually did* and somehow it's supposed to be my fault that things went south? How about laying some responsibility at the feet of the perpetrator of the harassment and discrimination? Jesus.\n"

    "title": "Some men are truly something else",
    "body": "\nSo this situation just happened :D I’m sorry for my bad grammar, English isn’t my first language. \nI met a guy, who’s like 4 years older than me, we go to the same uni. He seemed nice, although at our first meeting he told me something quite personal - that he used to have some mental problems. A red flag (I mean, who tells something like that to someone they’ve known for like an hour), but okay, I’m usually the type who lets some things go, so that’s what I did. I mentioned that I have a lot of unfinished work and he offered to help me, so I agreed. I mean why not. In the end we’ve met up 3 times. During this time I’ve found out that he doesn’t get along with people in his group (he talked like he’s better than them), doesn’t have friends outside of uni. That concerned me, because it’s kind of unusual to have absolutely no one. I’ve offered to introduce him to some interesting people, but he declined because “i don’t really need anyone, I’m content talking just with you”. At that point in time I’ve known him for less than a week, so it’s kind of weird that he said that. But once again, I’ve let that go. And the thing is, when talking to him in real life, he seems chill, but online is when the creepy stuff happens. \n\nI’ve mentioned to him that I’m the type who sometimes disappears, so it’s quite usual that I don’t answer for some time (it can happen for a few days, I just need to get my social battery charged up :D). So this Saturday I needed to go to uni to see a professor and give him my work, but I’ve overslept, so obviously didn’t go. Woke up to like 10 missed calls from him. Apparently he went to the auditorium where the seminar is held and didn’t see me there, so he decided to blow my phone up. I’m a headman in my group and have to see the deputy dean quite often (some organization matters), and he knew that. So he threatened me that if I didn’t pick up his call, he’ll go to him. So that was something, made me hella uncomfortable. We still haven’t even been acquainted for a week! And later, on Sunday, I told him that I was gonna disappear again. That day he texted me that he’s never going to get used to my disappearances (as if we’ve known each other for years), called a couple of times. I ignored all of that, didn’t answer because I truly wasn’t in the mood for that bullshit. Monday he texted me that I’m annoying him (as in making him go crazy with rage), had 16 missed calls. Not gonna lie, this made me hella anxious, that’s when I told my friends about this whole situation. They were immediately alarmed and rightfully so. On Tuesday I had to go to uni because of some physics labs and he knew that. So when I was on my way there he kept blowing up my phone, texting shit like “labs!!!!”. And then he literally texted me “I fucking hate you”. And then still called. And said that I fucking annoyed him so he’s going to the deputy dean. This shit would be hilarious, if it wasn’t that scary. One of my friends took me to a place where I can buy a pepper spray and taught me how to use it properly. I truly don’t know what’s going on inside that guys head, but showing up to my seminars when he doesn’t even have any lessons that day just to check if I’m there, threatening me with the deputy dean? telling he fucking hates me but still trying to contact me? I swear, this kind of behavior doesn’t even seem realistic. \n\nThankfully, one of my friends can be quite harsh and can tell someone to fuck off. So she took my phone and started texting him back with the intention of getting him off my back. And I’m glad she did that, because I would’ve gone about this way softer. When she told him that he’s being a creep and the way he’s acting is not normal, he just ignored all that and asked if I went to the uni to that physics lab. what. the. fuck. She kept on going, saying that ignoring what she said wasn’t gonna get solved anything, he still kept on deflecting, never explained his i fucking hate you, still tried to find out if I went to uni that day. I made my friend stop texting him, so his last questioned went unanswered. Currently this is the end, but god I’m so anxious going to uni now, he can easily find me and I REALLY don’t want to accidentally cross paths with him"

    "body": "Yesterday, I had some free time during the day so I decided to visit my bf at work. He works at a hardware store in the \"bad\" part of town, but it was daylight so I walked over and surprised him. \n\n\nHe only had like an hour and a half before he finished work so I decided I'd stick around and wait for him to finish and we'd walk back home together. \n\n\nHere's where it starts getting weird. I was feeling fine when I got to the store. I mentioned I was hungry and he showed me where they kept the coffee. I drank a cup and sat down in a chair in the front part of the store to do some work on my laptop. I finally got bored and grabbed some more coffee and walked around the store until it was close for him to go. \n\n\nThen I had to use the bathroom, so I left my stuff (backpack, coat and coffee) with him up on his podium thing and asked him to watch it while I went. \n\n\nBy then, it was time for him to clock out and he came back with my stuff to the area where you clock out, but he had left the coffee cup on the podium. It's just a cup btw, and has no cover thing on top of it. \n\n\nThe podium is out in the middle of the store, next to the registers and anyone can walk by it easily. I wanted to tell him to go back and grab it real fast, but I didn't and so I waited for him to clock out for a few minutes in the back, and then decided to go back and grab it myself. \n\n\nI grabbed it and start sipping it, and he comes out from the back and we start walking back home. I drink about half of it, and then it's cold so I throw the other half away. About five minutes after I started drinking that cup though, I start getting really giggly. Which isn't really that strange to either of us at the time, because I can get really giggly/hyper sometimes for no reason.\n\n\nBut then things get really weird, even for me. I get super tired and lay in the bed almost paralyzed. And I'm starting to say delusional things.. Like how he's an angel and how I must have died and gone to heaven. And it's not like in a cute way. I really did believe it. And then, we start getting touchy (sorry if tmi) but a friskiness starts followed by some intense orgasms. By then, I'm so tired I can't even speak properly. I keep zoning out and start feeling paranoid and some anxiety hits. I'm seeing shapes on the wallpaper patterns. My jaw gets all clenched. Like really clenched. Like every time I try to keep it still, it snaps closed. I'm slurring my words like I'm drunk and can't form proper sentences.\n\n\nBy then, I tell him I really don't think I'm okay. I tell him it's not like other days where I'm just zoning out. We have a hunch that something must have happened to the coffee while we had left it unattended at the podium. Anyways, I get some bad nausea and vomit a little, drink some water and ride out the night. \n\n\nToday, my bf goes to work and asks the lost prevention team(security) to check the footage to see if anyone had messed with my coffee on the podium for those few minutes. They take a look at it and tell him there was a man who walked by and \"waved his hand over it\" for those 2-3 minutes while we were gone.\n\n\nThey said there was no one else who came near it, but then go on to say they say they aren't even sure he had done anything, because according to them, he was really \"inconspicuous\" about it. They said he had just walked by and waved his hand like he was scratching his head when he came near it. \n\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me. It was barely busy when my bf and I went to the back of the store and left the coffee. A lot of the registers were open, so that there would be no real reason to walk by the podium. And we were only gone for like 5 minutes tops, so what are the chances of someone just walking by and waving their hand in front of the coffee during that time by chance?\n\n\nThey also said they had seen him in the store before. To me, this means that he might be familiar with the store and known where the cameras were and what to do to not look too suspicious. To them, they're saying they can't do anything until the guy walks into the store again. They said they'll watch him if he does come in again but pretty much, it's out of their hands until he comes back in again.\n\n\nI just don't know what to do now. All I know is that I was not feeling okay after I left that store. And I was lucky enough to have my bf with me to walk me home and make sure I was okay.\n\n\nI don't want whatever had happened to me to happen to some other person who may not have someone to walk them home or make sure they are okay...\n\n\n"

    "body": "My relationship with my brother isn't exactly healthy, but I can rest assured that a lot of it is due to his underlying issues that involve anger. We used to argue a lot as kids, which would often turn into physical fights, something I guess he hasn't grown out of. We're both in our 20's now (he's two years older than me), and have had pretty much the same upbringing. Without going into too much detail, growing up was hard at times and we had to deal with a lot, more than the typical kid, but I guess there's just some things he hasn't let go of, and for the lack of a better term, he increasingly shows signs of a typical victim mentality. \nAnyway, fast forward to two days ago (which is by no means the first time that this has happened) we got into a heated argument, he completely loses his temper and hurts me pretty bad. As a result, I've got some pretty gnarly bruising on my arms and wrists, a bump on the head, a perforated eardrum from when he punched me on the ear, and some minor scratches. I just picked up some antibiotics for my ear from my gp, where I had to lie and say it was an accident (completely ridiculous by the way, I should NOT have to be acting like the victim of domestic abuse at the hands of my brother!)\n\nApart from the physical aspect of his actions, it's the words that really hurt the most. He says the most soul crushing, unforgivable things that completely destroy my self esteem and make me want to just give up. It's no secret that words stick with you, but this just feels so wrong, so unforgiving. \n\nI just can't sleep, on top of everything else this is the last thing I need. I feel so horrible, I want to say numb but I'm in physical pain and my I can hear my stupid ear!

    "title": "UPDATE #1: 18/yo, PREGNANT, and scared out of my mind.",
    "body": "Hey friends,\n\nSo as I stated in my last post, I'd be making the long drive home from school this weekend to talk things out with Mom and boyfriend. I'm back at school now and wanted to share a small update. \n\nSomething I forgot to mention in my last post is that I'm anywhere from 6-8 weeks pregnant. My date of conception is pretty iffy at this point. \n\nUnfortunately, while we did talk, I wasn't really able to reach a decision. We've laid out our options, which I'll lay out for you, too (in no particular order): \n\n**1)** Abort. I still feel like this would be best, although devastating, for everyone involved. Emotionally devastating, but the best option in terms of my physical health and finances. Boyfriend has said that while he would *not* support my decision, he *would* support me emotionally and be there for me. But he feels like whenever he looks at me, he would resent me for murdering our unborn fetus, and that obviously hurts. But I understand where his pain is coming from, although I don't agree with his views. \n\n**2)** Bring to term, give away for adoption. (This one's a 2-parter.)  \n\n -He has a best friend that he goes to school with whose parents are very much wanting to adopt a baby... And when they found out that she has a friend who is expecting a baby (though they don't know who it is specifically), they really wanted *this* baby. However, my opinion towards his friend is pretty negative, because every time I've met her or interacted with her, she's been very rude and just plain crappy towards me. I understand this is probably a really petty reason for me to shy away from this, but I just guess I'd feel uncomfortable for half of my flesh and blood being with the family of a girl who is very unkind to me. I haven't met the rest of the girl's family, or her parents. \n\n -Place for adoption with a random family. I favor this option more. I'm warming up to it. As I understand it, open adoptions are pretty much the norm these days? I think I may be comfortable with that, with occasional updates and maybe visits. I feel in my heart that a more equipped family would be better for caring for a child more than me. In fact, I know that's the case. I know adoption is a hard decision, and this of course would require me to take a semester off for school next semester (my due date is estimated around the end of September/beginning of October) for the birth and recovery (although it's possible I could at least take a few online classes, or enroll with a university more local to home? -- I'd have to look into that more.) I'd love to say I'd be able to go back the following semester (Spring 2016) but realistically, I don't know if I'd be strong enough physically or mentally to do that yet. And giving birth seems super scary, in my opinion!\n\n**3)** Bring baby to term, raise it with boyfriend (and possibly mother). Boyfriend had the idea of my mom moving in with us while we took care of a baby, because ironically, my mom got pregnant at 18 as well. She's raised babies all her life. I'm her third child. I told him that I wouldn't want to put all that responsibility on her, and I'd feel awful about that. But she seemed enthusiastic about that, and very willing to help. So I have some mixed feelings about that. I just still don't think I'm ready to be a momma. I've never really been good with children. This December, just 2 months ago, was the first time I interacted with a newborn with a friend of mine had her baby. I had no idea. He cried as soon and as long as I held him! \n\nSo, here we stand, still unsure. **Thank you so much** for everyone who commented and reached out to me on my last post. I didn't get back to everyone, but I read everything, and all the insight helped me so much. \n\n**TL;DR: Still no decision reached yet. I still feel that abortion would be best. BUT, I'm warming up to the idea of giving it away for adoption, because almost every family out there would be a better family for this child than I would be, for sure. Keeping it and raising it myself is pretty low on the list.**"

    "body": "Honestly, I’m just ranting here, but I also want to warn others about an issue that I’ve come across throughout my life: the self proclaimed feminist.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I’m a feminist and my male partner is one too. However, my ex and some other men I’ve met in the past claimed to be feminists, when in reality, they were far from it. You see, they used feminism as a badge of honor, a bragging right, a way to appear more attractive to women. \n\n\nAnd boy, have I been fooled.\n\nI’ve dated this one guy for years who liked to think he was woke af but actually treated me like shit. Eventually, he wore me so down that I stopped wearing makeup, stopped dressing up, he kept me from speaking to other people at parties,  insulted me, isolated me, spoke down to me, mansplained, threatened me, traumatized me and been pressured me into sexual acts that I wasn’t comfortable with.\n\nIt wasn’t a fun ride. \n\nIt’s weird. I was in another abusive relationship before the “self proclaimed feminist”: That ex was conservative as can be. And I thought to myself after: You know what? This will never happen to me again because now I know the signs. \n\nBut my second ex’s “nice guy”-demeanor blinded me. And this is what makes these memories so difficult to carry around with me. Because I know this man will fool other women in the future. \n\nTherefore, I've taken a look back at this Fake Feminist Man and tried to identify the warning signs that I could have seen.\n\nSo ladies, if the “Feminist” Man you've just started dating showcases some of the following traits then he might be a phony:\n\n- He expects an award for being a decent person. Respecting women is great, but a real feminist would never expect anything in return for basic human decency.\n\n- He brags about eating 🐱. Sorry to break it to you, but that doesn’t make you a feminist.\n\n- He acts like he knows what women want & need BETTER than the women themselves. For instance, my ex would harshly judge any woman who liked taking raunchy photos/videos of herself (e.g. for OF) or who wore sexy clothes and/or makeup or got tattoos because “not a single woman does these things for herself”. True Feminist Men let women do what they want with their bodies.\n\n- He mansplains in general. \n\n- He truly believes that men & women cannot be platonic friends. A real feminist would not see every woman they come across as their next sexual conquest, would they? \n\n- He puts other men down because they claim to be the only one that could love you for who you are. And ALL other men are misogynistic. He, on the other hand, is your savior.\n\n- He judges other people (especially women) for being sex-positive. \n\n- He is intimidated by your success. \n\n- He doesn’t take your wants seriously. \n\n- Although he admits that household chores are everyone’s business, he utilizes weaponized incompetence. You are 26 and don’t know how to peel a potato, really? \n\n- Beware of “I’m a feminist, BUT”\n\n- He judges your taste in pop culture/music etc. BUT gets offended when you don’t like his favorite band or whatever. \n\n- He amplifies the rumour that only “alpha-males” can be sexist. Look, my ex was SO mad that I was abused by a conservative man before him. He said things like “Of course he’s the type of man to do that.”. This same guy ignored my verbal no and took raunchy pics of me without my consent. Rolling my eyes at the irony helps with the trauma.\n\n- Has ever muttered the phrase \"real women have ______”\n\n- His feminism is not intersectional. What are his opinions on LGBTQ+, Black rights etc.? \n\n- Although he keeps saying that r*pe is bad, he victim blames. \n\nIn the end, people can claim to be anything. I’m not saying that men cannot be good feminists or good allies, but we should always let actions speak louder than words. Stay safe."

    "body": "Venting mostly.\n\nI am a cisgender female. I dress relatively feminine and have natural curves. I don't feel like I behave or seem like I'm particularly masculine. But, I've always had a deeper voice since I was a kid. This has brought on a lot of difficulties and rude behavior from people who were bewildered at the idea that a girl could have a deeper voice. I already struggle with interacting with people to an extent because I'm shy and get sexually harassed often, but the ones who hear me speak and can't handle it make me feel sick. Some examples:\n\n* When I was in 6th grade I asked for a classmate's phone number to chat in an effort to make friends. When I called, her father answered and blew the fuck up at both of us because he thought I was a boy. Classmate showed me to her dad like... six months later when there was an event at school. I'd about blocked it out of my mind at that point; he had a weird sheepish grin and weakly said sorry.\n\n* Middle school is of course awful for many people; for me it sucked being mocked and treated like a pariah so often just because I had a deeper voice and gave a shit about school. I wanted to transfer schools but all of the eligible schools in my district were pretty awful tbh, and I felt like I couldn't confide in my parents. We were never really close or discussed feelings unless it was in a more negative light, and I generally had the mindset that I have to endure things that I don't want to no matter how miserable I am. So ultimately I became cynical and withdrawn, my grades fell, and they wrote me off as being spoiled and lazy with a bad attitude, while peers would call me negative. Lots of angry crying!\n\n* Small children often flat out exclaim I sound like a boy or ask if I am one. If I deny being one they will not believe me. If I try to joke about it, it's still embarrassing and I don't want to be mean to a little kid or otherwise confuse them about gender shit and possibly lead them to make bad assumptions.\n\n* I've had parents stop in their tracks and stare at me when I was in high school. One, albeit trying to be nice, remarked about my 'smooth baritone' voice.\n\n* If I go to bars there have regularly been guys who ask if I am transgender, usually after trying to flirt with me. Sometimes I would go to gay bars and get asked this, and they're nice about it, but definitely had been told 'your body is great, those are good hormones/implants' until I corrected them. \n\n* When I went on a trip with friends last year and went into a bathroom after a bit of wine tasting, I approached the stalls and realized they were both occupied. I quietly whispered to myself 'oop, both occupied'. One of the women in the stalls immediately loudly said \"WHAT? IS THERE A GUY IN HERE??\" so I replied \"NO I JUST HAVE A DEEP VOICE\" and she went \"oh\", and a woman who was at the sink just kind of chuckled and said \"come on, remember diversity\" or something along those lines. Accusing lady gave me a nervous smile when she left the stall and I just scoffed at her.\n\n* Phone calls suck, even if I say my very feminine name and use feminine prefixes and pronouns, I've had callers insist on calling me 'sir' or seem confused that I am referring to myself and am not speaking on behalf of myself. I work remotely and even though I've been on the same team with the same people for six months, the project manager randomly referred to me by saying 'his ticket' last week.\n\nBut yeah I don't know. I'm just tired of it. I try not to take it personally. It's not like I sound like Dr Girlfriend from Venture Brothers (but obviously it wouldn't matter even if I did). These people question my gender/sex more than I ever thought to. I've tried to train my voice to sound a bit higher, but even when I use my 'higher' voice then it also sounds kind of off to others I guess, as I've had people straight up laugh in my face or ask if I have strep throat when they would hear me speak in this tone.\n\nThat being said, I've had people compliment my voice too and describe it as sexy or a radio voice, so it hasn't been a completely awful experience, but it seems like it's often a weird lust for or an extreme hatred of my voice when indifference would be great.\n\ntldr i'm a cis woman, my voice is very deep and people have been weird/mean about it my entire life and now i'm crazy, why can't they chill out and mind their gd business ugh\n\neta: thanks all for being supportive. I do like my voice and don't wish to change it as much as train it, if that makes sense. just fyi to anyone who may think I have a problem with being called trans, I have no issue with those that are trans & genderqueer, and it doesn't upset me if people think I may be. I get that people may wonder and not think about how it may seem to me. We're all people. Sometimes it can be a funny experience and I try to go with the flow. Mainly it is just frustrating when people get in my face about it, mock me, or don't believe me when it just wasn't their business in the first place. I apologize if anything I said seemed to imply this."

    "title": "Male got aggressive, screamed, and threatened me in a coffee shop I frequent. People are telling me to get over it.",
    "body": "This happened yesterday and I haven't slept most of the night. I just took some of the beta blockers I have handy today to give my heart and adrenaline system a break.\n\nSo to start, I may possibly be omitting some things because I am autistic and have a very strong freeze response, as well as documented history of temporary dissociative memory loss under stress which I tend to recover later. I do see a therapist regularly, and I've yet to see her about this but I will do that. \n\nSo I made my order yesterday and went off to the side. I realized I was struggling with my cups so I went back to the counter to ask for a tray. The male who looked to be in his 40s was in the middle of his order, with a toddler aged child next to him. \n\nNow, I'm generally known to be very polite, but I do struggle with etiquette in these situations so I usually go by most common social observations. I've had people just go in front of me or call the cashier over as they may be working on mine, so I was wondering if I could do the same. I hadn't said anything yet to the cashier and she had her back to us, when the male to my side said something about waiting for him to finish the order to me. \n\nI informed him that I already placed mine and just needed something (and presumably the cashier would figure it out herself what order she wanted to go in). He immediately escalates by raising his voice and turning to me and saying he doesn't care. I don't think I was able to say anything else after because one, screaming is like a bomb to my face because of my sensitivity, and two, he began screaming into my face, advancing towards me, definitely in my space at that point, and yelling at me to get away from him and his child. He said he will stab me. He was much taller than me, looked like he was about to strike me, I left very quickly in fear of my safety. \n\nI have this whole feeling of unreality because this has never happened to me before, especially in a place that's public. I felt weak, overpowered in every way from his shouting over every word of mine with my ears ringing and advancing on me and threatening me while somehow using his child as leverage. I take care of my elderly grandparents and I can't imagine ever near assaulting someone for what exactly?\n\nI did call the police, but as the cctv footage I obtained from one store later that day showed, he realized I was doing that when he saw me outside on the phone and had hidden and then changed direction in order to lose me giving them directions on where to find to him. I am still waiting on whether Dunkin will give me their footage. As the police took an hour to come in the end, by that time I had made my way to the police station a few blocks away and filed a report. All it says is Harassment. When I'm literally now looking at every single person's face when I was avoiding that before to make sure he doesn't see me before I see him. I have actually never felt such overwhelming rush of violent threat personally directed at me in such close range. I take the subway regularly and faced threats there, personal ones based on skin color, but even that never caused this kind of trauma.\n\nEvery person I've talked to so far about this has said it's not worth my time to pursue and that this happens constantly. I believe it. The one silver lining was that as I've been asking every store to share their footage of him walking down the block, they have expressed a very unexpected amount of sympathy and kindness and understanding, many sharing the same situation. Actually all women telling me, one showing me footage, of their harassment and how nothing was done.\n\nBut just because I \"didn't lose a leg\" as one family member told me, doesn't mean I'm going to do nothing and hope never to see him again in my own neighborhood. I'm going to see how much clear pictures I can get, update the police with them who will likely do nothing but that's okay, hang up posters all around with his face and an amount offered for his name which I will consider how to transact safely, and if all goes my way, pursue a civil case for the amount of therapy I'm now going to pursue. (I'm taking this as my sign to finally try out ketamine therapy since it will not be safe once I begin my newly prescribed thyroid medicine). \n\nI know a lot of people will say I'm overreacting but I am genuinely built differently and it took me a long time to get as much confidence as I do have in public because noise, confusing unscripted situations, threats, difficulty with speech due to sensory processing. I shouldn't be the one being afraid in my own neighborhood, he should now feel hunted, and he should not be free to use his kid as a justification for being a active aggressor. This is truly the therapy that works best for my personality - doing something, and I've been doing this my entire life from standing up to school bullies in childhood. "

    "body": "Long time listener, first time caller.\n\ntw: sexual assault\n\nI’m a server at a popular live music bar.\nIn January, I was sexually assaulted by a coworker at a holiday party. For the purpose of this story, we’ll refer to him as “H”. H has a reputation with many people where I live for being a slimy bastard who manipulates women. I noted this immediately and tried my very best to stay away from him. I had quite a few drinks at our holiday party and wasn’t of sound enough mind to deny his advances. He kept insisting that I come home with him and wouldn’t stop touching me (grabbing my breasts and feeling around my genitals) after trying to get away from him. I didn’t report him to management because it’s a small business and H has a lot of seniority and is well-liked; I didn’t think it would do any good.\n\nFast forward a few months, our bar is purchased by a company that owns several bars in the area. The management at the time is forced to resign and H is made the general manager of the bar. I was very angry but continued working there because I needed the money. I also happen to love all of the other employees at the bar, the clientele, the performers... and I didn’t want to leave that behind and let this scumbag win.\n\nPrior to the assault, I started talking to one of the house performers at the bar (we’ll call him A) and H took it upon himself to draw a competition from it. H began trying to bet A on “who would fuck me first” and insisting that he was going to “get with me” to him. After H assumed the management position, A and I started dating. H didn’t take kindly to this and began targeting me by making me do the most difficult jobs consistently and holding me to higher expectations than other employees.\n\nThe final straw was pulled when he denied a request off that I placed a full month in advance to attend the wedding of a good friend. I almost never ask for time off, and if I do, it’s for a damn good reason. Two other coworkers (one of which, I am certain placed their request off after I did) got that day off and I was scheduled.\n\nI am heartbroken to leave a job I love so dearly but thankful and grateful to close a dark chapter that shattered my spirit in so many ways.\n\nThanks for reading. Love and light to all.\n\n"

    "body": "Throwaway because my friends know my real account. I realize I may be wrong, but I really feel like I've been abandoned. Growing up through school I was a loner and as such, I only had a handful of friends. We were very close, like sisters, all the way from kindergarten up to when I got married. I asked them to be in the bridal party, and since I knew it would be a strain on finances, I simply gave them a color and said, buy a dress, doesn't matter where you get it. I asked them to be in the wedding two years before the ceremony would take place. We got up to the very end of the planning process and none of them had bought a dress. They hadn't even looked. One person, my bestie, came through and purchased hers like a month before the wedding. The rest would not. Being that we were so close to the day and I was panicky, I went ahead and purchased four new gowns, forsaking my good photographer in the process and settling for a new photographer. None of them attended or helped out with the bridal shower or bachelorette party, which dumped all of that on my maid of honor, after they agreed to help her. \n\nOn the day of the wedding, they showed up. I handed out the gifts I had painstakingly chosen and wrapped for each if them. All they did was complain. I decided to let it go and enjoy my wedding. I won't go into detail, but let's just say they completely let me down. I was angry and stopped talking to them for a while. When I started talking to them again, I made it clear how hurt I was, and that I expected to be paid back for their dresses. They all agreed to pay me back. \n\nI got my pictures back, and was just devastated. She missed so many of the ones I asked for, that can't be redone. None of them showed my husband smiling. There isn't a single photo of me with my family. I feel like if I had been able to keep my good photographer, I would have those pictures. \n\nNow it's been two years since all of that went down. I still haven't done anything with the pictures because it makes me so sad to look at them. None of my friends have given me a single dime back, nor any apology or anything. They have all gotten married, had kids. I wasn't invited to any of their weddings, not even my bestie. I wasn't told when they got pregnant or had their kids. I've repeatedly asked to hang out and catch up, no response. I feel like after I got married, they felt I wasn't good enough anymore. I wasn't a bridezilla, I was actually pretty laid back until the last month. I didn't push them to do anything besides get a dress. I don't know any reason they'd be upset with me. I can't get an answer out of any of them to even try to restore our friendship. \n\nEven now, I'm angry that they've given up on me. They don't seem to care. I don't think I've done anything to deserve it. I know people grow apart, but this is different. They're avoiding all contact with me. I feel so alone."

I feel ridiculed every time I ask for help, either with my homework or with a work related issue. Today, I couldn’t figure out a really complicated python question for extra credit, and got made fun of my two of my male coworkers. They even asked why I was majoring in IT anyways if I couldn’t figure it out, or know some things about python. This class is an intro course!! It’s my second semester!! They’re both juniors, way ahead of me. They both tried to figure it out  (and couldn’t) and I just left work crying because I was so upset. This happens so much I can’t deal with it anymore.

We were both single at the same time and we made out in his car. We talked a bunch and on my next visit it was implied that something more would happen. I went to his house and his whole mood changed. Our friends left and he was really cold. We were watching TV and the rest of this is a really blurry memory (easily over 12 years ago). I remember his pants off and him saying something about how he can just get what he wants from me. Somehow I am in his bed and he penetrates me. I move away and he does it again and says I am wet. He does not have a condom so that’s the reason I give when he tries again. He says something about me not trusting him to pull out.

I leave the next morning and we don’t talk again minus some penis joke text some time later that I call him on and he responds “just a joke”. \n\nNow I’m sad that I have to remember all of this again.

What if I don't have the internal gumption to do so and just leave it then freak out all night about how I'll become that \"massive shit, toilet,  clogger girl that we don't invite to parties anymore.\" Any number of things could go wrong!\n\nAnyways, most normal humans have a plunger under their bathroom sink or at least somewhere logically close to their toilet. I guess no one in my boyfriend's family is sane, human and/or logical. \n\nThus begins the start of a poop induced panic attack.\n\nMortified, I go to my boyfriend's room and ask where they keep the plunger. He said his parents' bathroom so I searched but to no avail. Who has two toilets and no plunger by either?

They are practically the same person. They went periods of their life not speaking to each other because of petty differences. When I was 18 I fell in love and since he was catholic she kicked me out and shunned me for two years. I am now engaged and having the child of the same man whom I love dearly. My grandma was diagnosed with cancer and my relationship with my mother is now a reflection or cycle of my mother and grandmother. My mother made up with my grandmother and can only have one relationship at a time. My grandma and I have never been close because of their relationship. There were years at a time there was no contact. Now here we are and my brother and I have tried to make contact and make ammends with my judgemental grandmother because its the right thing to do but she refused to let us in. Now I get a call from my brother since my mother and I are still not speaking, that my grandmother has only hours left at the hospice center before she passes away and we're not allowed to see her. My mother is using my grandmother's death as a punishment for my brother and I to suffer through. I do not want her at my labor or my wedding at this point. We are not speaking because she doesn't approve of the baby or the marriage and I will never be good enough for her. Yet its all my fault. Her whole side of the family hates me because of horrible lies she's told including my little sister who I miss terribly. Shes 11 and my half sister but we were so close I never noticed. Now she hates me cause of lies and my mom has kept us apart. Everything is so messed up that my new goal is to be the best wife and mother I can be with UNCONDITIONAL love. I feel so bad for my fiance to go through this with me. I will never understand my family and just want to break the cycle. Thanks for reading. I feel like crap now that I have to sit here and wait while my grandma dies. Sorry for the wall of text. Im on mobile and I just needed to vent. \n\nUPDATE: it was against my grandmothers wishes and my mother has helped her make that decision by telling her me and my brother said she can die with a grudge. My mother has written both my brother and I last night saying why come now if we didnt all this time which is untrue because we were told my grandmother didn't want us to see her that way. Then I got a message from my mother this morning since facebook doesn't allow you to reblock for 48 hours and my mother says she forgives me which is fanfreakingtastic. My mother might just be crazy enough to be suicidal. I've exposed it online publicly so other people can see how messed up this situation is. I miss my 11 year old sister dearly so I put a public post up for her to see explaining what has happened and I hope she sees it. As of now she thinks I don't want to come around because my mother has told her I hate her. As far as my grandmother passing, this is how she wants it. A few of you asked why I even wanted to see her after a life of drama and fighting and mental unstability and I can't even answer that. But if she wants it this way then I can't change her mind. I told my mother not to talk to me anymore and that is why she said she forgives me in case anything happens to her. Its always been about her. My mother. Guilt tripping and stressed. Everyone in my family suspects there is something not right with her mentally. Maybe sociopathic. I just hope my sister can understand when she is free of this too. My brother and I were both kicked out at 18. I hope she gets it easier. "

This happened earlier today and I still don’t know what to Do with myself.\n\nI was walking to a park on the lake in my city, and it’s a beautiful day so I was going to go for a swim which I’ve been doing a lot lately. It’s a good coping mechanism. And as I was walking to the tunnel that goes under the highway to get to this park, a guy walks up fast next to me and starts talking real loudly, so I took out my headphones and was like what cuz I was startled but trying to not show it. And he started in with that creepy guy hitting on you in public routine, you know the type, overly persistent, overly familiar, crude. He added to it by catching on that I’m a lesbian and throwing homophobic crap in there like is there anything I can do about that (being gay) to change it?  And I just kept trying to politely decline his requests for my name and number, where i live, if I’m meeting anyone, if he can come swimming with me. And eventually, once i was out of the tunnel, I just said you have a nice day and put on my earbuds and tried to wlak away from him as fast as I could. \n\nWell he continued to follow me, I had all kinds of bad feelings at this point. I was feeling uncomfortable so I called my girlfriend and had her on the phone as I walked towards the lake ore, because I knew there would be other people at the lakeshore who I could just have as witnesses. And it was hot so I was hoping he’d abandon following me and i could still swim. Well he followed from afar until I hit the lake, and then he went and sat on the top stair leading down to the pier, directly behind me. It is a big lake and a big park. He was aboslutely following me. So I kept my girlfriend on the line, and tried to not make eye contact hoping he’d leave me alone. This went on for about 25 minutes, it was scary as hell, but I missed something that would have made it even scarier. \n\nSomeone had called the cops because he was shouting vague threats to me not fifteen feet away, and WAVING A MACHETE. Yes a f*king machete. I feel like I escaped death today barely, but the cops? Barely cared, they said they took his machete and didn’t arrest him, and that I shouldn’t let it ruin my day. He threatened to kill me with a machete because I declined his advances and the cops simply did not care despite all the witnesses, they wrote it off as him being mentally unwell and that’s that. \n\nI couldn’t leave because I’d have to walk past him to do so, I was hoping to wait him out and that he’d leave me alone but he didn’t and I’m so glad the cops showed up but I’m livid that they didn’t arrest him or so much as ask for my name. I’m deciding if I should go to the cops tomorrow but I’m really scared given past experiences being unable to report a SA to them."

I never once got paid or ask for money as I was just happy for a place to stay, plus I felt like she was also on the poor side of life receiving food stamps and such. Once I move in she started working as an RN at a not so local hospital. Everything was going fine, then things started to change. She would be gone all the time. I'm talking leaving at 4 am and staying out till 11pm or later. On her days off she would just leave. At about the two month mark she turned into an ocd freak and nothing I cleaned was ever good enough. Whatever I sucked it up and started looking for a job and my own place, but trying to run a family by yourself is fucking time consuming and I didn't have any luck. Then she gets fired and goes fucking crazy. Talking about killing herself, burning family photographs, saying she was going to take her kid and run away to mexico. This goes on for about a week. Then one day she text a family member saying sheing going to kill herself. The cops come and do a well check, they leave. About 45 min later they come back and ask to see her. I go in and get her and they try to take her to get help, but she refuses to go and fights them. So now she's taken to the hospitals and is under arrest for biting the cops. I stuck with her kid. Just stuck. The child is asking me where mommy is and I have no idea what to say. After say two days social services gets involved and tells us to just sit tight for a few days. The next day the mother calls me and ask for me to come pick her up from the hospital. Once I pick her up she ask if I could take her to the bank. She goes in and about 15 mins later she comes back with 20k and hands it to me. Then she has me drive her down to the jail and she turns herself in for the assault. She tells me the money is so I can bail her out. The next day SS calls me to say the kids grandparent was coming to pick and ask if I could locate the birth certificate. I started packing everything the poor child owns and digging in the mothers papers. That's when I found the one paper that made me the maddest ever. Before she had her child she was a nanny for a family doing far less than I ever did living with them getting paid $800 A WEEK! So not only did she have the money to pay me, she knew she should be paying me. So how that same day she finds out that the grandparent is coming she calls me from jail saying I'm the reason she's lossing she child and that when she gets of she's going to kidnap my child and take her to Mexico. I hang up and call the police. They come and I pack up all of our stuff give them the money and keys and get the fuck out of there. I had to go to a safe home. I now know that this was a form if human trafficking. I was a slave. I'm hurt, I feel like I lost my own child, I just don't know what to do.\n\nSorry for the long read and sorry for the typos, dyslexia is a bitch."

I've posted any updates, knowledge, or resources, and none of the men I know have taken any of it seriously. I've seen so many guys post jokes about how they can no longer give \"creampies\".

I still haven't lost the baby weight that I put on while pregnant, and over all I just feel like I'm not good enough. \nSo last week my husband (we've been together for 12 years and married for 7) decided to let me in on some \"great news\". His boss has decided to have him close every Friday night so that he and his other guy coworkers can go out to a bar. Fine, I get it, he wants to have some guy time. But then he decided to let me know where they are going to make the weekly hangout be, \"this new place that's kinda like a sexier hooters with a ski resort kinda thing\" awesome. Why not just go to the strip bar? I should mention he told me this in the middle of shark week. \nSo today has been a tough day with my son and I'm just feeling like I have no self worth. And I picked him up tonight from the twin peaks place and I just felt so inadequate. It's hard to explain to him how depressed I am but it was just so much today and then on top of it I get to pull up to this place and wonder which of the girls was his waitress and wonder just how much time was spent talking amongst his friends about how great she looks. Then he has to come home to his chubby yoga pants wearing wife. I'm just so over everything tonight. \nThanks for reading.\n"

    "body": "My husband and I have known each other since we were in the 5th grade. We became really good friends during middle school  and that friendship remained up until sophomore year of high school when he started dating my younger sister who was a freshman at the time.\n\nI was completely heart broken because they both knew I harbored a crush for him. Because of this I distanced myself from both as best I could— they eventually told my parents that they were dating and it really hurt having to watch them be a couple over dinner whenever they would invite him over.\n\nThey dated for 7 years before breaking up when my sister came out as a lesbian. \n\nIn late 2017 I was visiting my parents back home and ran into him at the store. He invited me out to coffee and I agreed. We kept in touch when I went back home and he eventually asked me out. \n\nMy old crush on him had resurfaced but I didn’t immediately accept because I needed to ask my sister first. When I talked to her she said it was fine because she’d never really felt herself with him and it was only after she’d had her first girlfriend that she’d realized what being 100% happy in a relationship really felt like. \n\nFast forward to end of 2018 and he proposes to me, which I immediately accept. We got married in June of 2019 — just a small courthouse wedding followed by a nice banquet for friends and family.\n\nUp until that point I’d remained a virgin. It wasn’t for any religious belief — I’d simply decided that that was the best choice for me after my first boyfriend tried pressuring me into it. \n\nWe weren’t intimate on our wedding night because we were too exhausted nor the next morning because we had to be at the airport early to leave for our honey moon. Our first night in the resort he tried to initiate sex. It was going fine and I was really excited up until I remembered that he’d lost his own virginity to my younger sister. I freaked out and practically ran out of the room. It was a weird moment for the both of us.\n\nWe’re less than 4 months away from our one year anniversary and we still haven’t been intimate. I’ve told him what’s been going on with me, and how I feel physically like puking every time we’re about to cross the threshold because the knowledge that he’s had sex with my sister always pops up right as we’re getting close. I have no idea why it happens. It’s also not in a “holding a grudge” kind of way but more in a “you’ve been inside my sister and now you’re going to be inside of me” kind of way. It’s a really strange, borderline creepy, feeling.\n\nBecause we’ve been on lockdown together, he’s been trying extra hard to initiate sex but I keep rebuffing. A week ago he finally snapped and told me it was ridiculous that he couldn’t have sex with his own wife and then accused me of punishing him because he’d dated my sister when I’d had a crush on him. We’ve been avoiding each other since.\n\nI’ve been thinking it over these last few days and I think the best thing for us would be to divorce. I just don’t see myself ever craving to have sex with him. Right now I’m seriously regretting having chosen to stay a virgin—  if we’d tried having sex while only dating then I would have discovered this grossed out feeling of committing a taboo I get a lot sooner."

THEN I will have to pay full price for the appointment and the ultrasound he does to confirm correct placement.\n\nI guess I'm ranting because I don't make a lot of money but I apparently make enough to not get the health care I need. Now I'm stuck paying a ton of money (and I know over the period of 5 years that it is the most cost-effective option but shelling out that much at once is awful).

Any clarifications I will be happy to answer. \n\nI quit my job a couple weeks ago. I worked in the car business for 3 years and worked with all men. \n\nAt the dealership, there was this one instance of another manager at a different (sister) store who helped me put a deal together. My managers were fine with it, but made sure to say \"the only reason he's helping you is because you're an attractive young female, if you were any of the guys here he wouldn't bother to help you.\" BOY did that rub me the wrong way. \n\nSmall things like that kept happening. Talking down to me, talking over me, giving a correct answer and them not believing me until a different salesman repeats it, etc... I got so fed up that I called my boyfriend at work, almost in tears, and told him I was quitting. He said \"That's fine baby. We'll figure it out, do what you need to do.\" I walked in to the managers office and quit. \n\nWhen they sent me my exit interview it was 35 questions. My bf said \"Now is the time to tell them what you told me. How you feel like they were treating you different because you're a woman.\" I said \"I don't want to say that though...I don't want to pull that card. If they read that they'll probably think 'she's lying and being dramatic'\". He looked at me very seriously and said \"If you feel that way, then you DEFINITELY need to be honest.\" \n\nSo I was. I was honest and it was almost cathartic. Im not sure anything will come of it. But now I work at a bridal boutique selling wedding gowns, surrounded by women and I have NEVER been this happy at a job in my life. \n\nTL;DR Working with all men at a dealership sucks and towards the end I really started to hate my life and feel mistreated."

    "body": "I wasn't sure where I could discuss this, and I hope it's okay if I talk about our situation here. I'm a mom of three boys and a girl. My twins who are 26, my third son who is 23, and my young daughter, 12. They're all precious to me and I'm so proud of them. I was relatively young (22) when I married my husband and had our first children, but more than anything I love being a mom and raising my twin boys was such an amazing experience, and my husband and I always planned on three children, and after three years we welcomed our youngest son into the family. By nature my third son 'C' was so gentle, well-behaved, creative and a little shy, in contrast to the boisterous and outgoing personalities of his older brothers, 'A' and 'B' (daughter is D, and the fact their first names are in alphabetical order is entirely coincidental). All in all he was an extremely happy boy. By the time our boys were 14 and 11, hubby and I agreed on having one more child, and I finally had a daughter, which I was ecstatic by to have a little girl. Around that time, C started to become a lot more introverted and unsociable. He was so excited about being a big brother, and he's always so protective and caring of D, she thinks the world of him, so I knew jealously didn't alter his behavior, but he at an age where puberty was starting to hit so I wasn't really alarmed. However through his teen years he appeared to be getting worse. His grades were falling, he didn't appear to have many friends, and he was so reserved and secretive and he rarely spoke. He was never aggressive, he just always appeared to be sad. I was worried that he was being bullied be he wouldn't talk to me, every time I asked it was always just \"I'm alright\" and \"I'm doing fine\" followed by a false smile. I tried my best to help him, and he did pass school and went on to college, and for awhile it seemed like he was doing better to come out of his shell but there was still always part of him on the defence. When he was 22 he came out to me as gay, and I was honestly so relieved when he did because I thought he was finally opening to me and that this was the reason growing up seemed so difficult for him. He's fully out and open to everyone now, and seemed somewhat happier but he still had a very quiet and reserved side to him that at this point I believed was just his nature, but he was still really struggling in college and depressed. Last year after arriving home from work, my husband told me that C was upstairs and he had something extremely important to tell me. We went to his room and he was distressed and in tears, trying to hold it together. After a little time he finally confessed that he was assaulted sexually when he was 11. I don't know many details, all he's told me so far is that it was more than one stranger, and that it was violent. I cried so much with him, and I of course told him that this happens to so many people, it happens to children, it happens to men and it is never the victim's fault. He's seen a doctor, and he's been seeing a therapist for about 2 months now, but I can tell this is so hard on him. He still tries to put on a happy face most of the time but he's struggling. Every day I'm so afraid for his safety and well-being. \n\nI'm finding this so difficult to cope with myself. I feel like a failure for not protecting my child. I should of seen all of the early signs that something wasn't right. I want to be able to fix this, I want him to have his childhood back, but I know I can't do that, and it makes me feel useless. I'm ashamed of myself, I'm hurt that he felt like he couldn't trust me enough to tell me when he was still 11. I don't know how to fix an adult. I don't know what I'm asking for here either, I just need to cry and vent. Does anyone have advice on coping? Or is there anyone else here any experience with being the parent of a rape victim? \nI love him so much it hurts. \n\nEdit: I truly want to thank everyone who responded with such kindness and excellent advice. On my off breaks I have been looking into counselling for Myself and C's dad. This weekend we will have a serious discussion about our options. My Son is a strong, nurturing, intelligent and beautiful young man and while I know No one can take on and fight this turmoil for him (even though he needs a break), he won't be alone. We will support and love him. His best friend knows as well, so he has support outside this household too. "

    "body": "I'm at a loss here. I have been in a relationship with the same guy for nearly four years and I'm experiencing a lot of issues. I know it's normal to discover that one's partner is imperfect, but I'm at a point where the \"imperfections\" are wearing on me. Since I don't post often, here's some background:\n\nI am a 27 year old female, he's a 31 year old male. We met at my place of employment when I was still working in bars. I'm in an office now and I work hard at my job. I have bipolar disorder, am a survivor of assault, and am actively trying to cope with these things. \n\nIn any case, I'm starting to think I'm losing my mind here and I guess I just need confirmation that I'm not alone with the boyfriend-related things that are driving me nuts. Sorry in advance for the rant. Here's the list:\n\n1. He will argue for the sake of arguing. Seriously, he'll argue about how I put his clothes away when I'm the only one who does it. \n\n2. He expects me to call him, then has nothing to say.  Um, I pretty much hate being on the phone unless there's a good amount of conversation going on. \n\n3. He lies to my face about ridiculous things and then tries to backpedal when I catch him in it. Yet he still thinks I'm the one to be wary of (probably a result of his parents'divorce)\n\n4. On more than one occasion, I've caught him looking at porn in the same freaking room I'm in/looking at other women when we're out together. I hate to be judgy, but I can't help but feel like that's really pathetic. It's also really offensive and disrespectful to me that he'd behave that way around me. Of course, I'm of the mindset that he can't possibly love me if he hates women enough to objectify an entire gender at every opportunity. \n\n5. He's a lazy, unmotivated slob with no future- which it's something I could overlook pretty easily if #4 didn't grind my gears so much... But his behavior is really starting to rub off on me. \n\n6. I love him but I don't want to live with him anymore. He's a totally horrible roommate. \n\n7. Going back to the porn, I'm sure that's the main reason why he never initiates any physical activity with me anymore. \n\nI feel gross and unappreciated. Do you think there's any way to save this or should I cut my losses and move on? Is it reasonable that I'm annoyed/bothered by his behavior that it makes me really question being around him? Sometimes I look at him and he just looks like another person, nothing special... Like the emotional connection has shorted out. \n\nSorry for rambling. I just need to sometimes. Bring on the downvotes for my hatred of pornography use by my boyfriend and his other misogynistic tendencies. "

    "body": "*Trigger warning* *Abuse*\n\n\n\nAs the title states. This is my main account and I've decided I have no reason to hide. \n\nI've been with my partner for around 2 years. He's really great and makes me feel calm and loved. We are looking at getting a new place together and the topic of proposing has come up once or twice. But our relationship has felt a bit off recently, and it's ME. I've been guarded and in my own head. He says that he isn't sure what I'm thinking and can tell I'm dealing with something but figured it was due to stress from a recent surgery and the pandemic in general. \n\nBut it's because I've never shared my story of the abuse I faced in my last relationship. I've had about a million opportunities to tell him and could never get the courage or find the 'right time' but it's affecting me so much lately, I feel like I'm going to explode.\n\nMy ex would abuse me in my sleep. I researched his behaviour early on in the relationship and learned about something called sexsomnia. He was never diagnosed over the 7 years we dated but I always made the excuse that he had a 'medical condition'. I couldn't talk to anyone because I rationalized it as his business that I didn't have a right to share. I was an idiot. He was never fully conscious while he assaulted me, at least to my knowledge. I would wake up in the morning if I slept at all, to him happy and rested, seemingly unaware of what the fuck he did to me the night previous. I would share with him what he did and his usual response of \"so sorry!\" eventually turned into just straight up blaming me for him being repressed sexually, y'know what could I expect when he wasn't getting any?! (I have Endometriosis and sex is never a guarantee day to day, my pain always interfered.) It escalated over the years and by the end of our relationship just the thought of him touching me in anyway shape or form disgusted and horrified me. I cringed when him or anyone touched me. I eventually women'd up and got the fuck out of that relationship, but never took the time to heal and never looked back.\n\nI didn't think I was being abused at the time, but after working with a therapist I realized he was *never actually diagnosed*  by a medical professional. He actively and knowingly violated me for years. And blamed me for it.\n\nMy partner deserves to know before we get deeper into this. I finally texted and told him I needed to share something with him tonight so I couldn't wuss out and not say anything again. I'm freaking the actual fuck out and I don't know how to tell him. I wanted it to be in person so that if he had questions I could explain myself. If anyone has any advice or is willing to share their story, I would be eternally grateful. Thanks for reading if you took the time xo.\n\nTLDR; I want to share my sexual assult story with my partner before our relationship gets more serious."

    "body": "I've asked this here before, but was met with a lot of vitriol, but I'm hopeful I can explain my situation better and be met with more advice than down votes. If there's a better sub to post this in, please redirect me and I'll cross post. When I was 12 years old I got my first period. I spent three days lying on the bathroom floor, alternating between throwing up and sitting on the toilet, unable to think clearly I was in so much pain. By the fourth day, I took 4 ibuprofen in a row and was able to get up. I started going through a rather interesting puberty when I was around 13. My voice broke and deepened. I began growing a beard and hair on my chest and stomach. My acne went bonkers. My boobs grew in, oddly. They are not full, and even if they stayed this small, they are stuck at a rather immature, half grown in phase. From age 12 to age 17, I thought everyone had to leave school when they got their period. I thought everyone was overdosing on pain killers as their cramps started at their backs and went down to their feet. I thought everyone had killer hot flashes. But then I went to college and found out none of that was the norm. First gynecologist visit. I talk about my body hair, my facial hair, my random periods (one month, skip two months, then get it one week then a week later get it again), the pain I had during sex, how scary it was to poop while on my period because it hurt so bad, etc. She decided to take an ultrasound of my ovaries. My ovaries are littered with cysts. But it's not the worst she had seen. And it didn't explain all of my symptoms. Most, but there were a few lingering. So they do another ultrasound, looking not at my ovaries but around my uterus and surrounding organs. What they find isn't pretty. It's endometriosis. I was having such horrible pains because it's attached itself to everything. It wanted to be friends with all the organs I guess -.- I get put on birth control to help control it. We try a lot of different medications. My ovaries are making testosterone, my utuerus is acting clingy to all my organs and the symptoms go away while I'm on it,the second I miss a pill/meds or try to stop it, I'm back on the floor 12 years old, wondering why it hurts this bad. I'm sorry if I'm ranting. I'm trying to give the full picture. I desperately wanted to be a mom. I knew even when I was young, I wanted to become a mommy and have kids. Thats' what I put up with it. Those periods were worth it because one day they'd result in children and I'd be happy. I kept telling myself, as I slept with ice packs and I popped pills, one day I'd look back and be grateful. Then my gynecologist tells me, with PCOS, endometriosis and type 1 diabetes of my entire life, I should not have kids. That I should consider a hysterectomy. I might be infertile. Even when off birth control, sometimes I've had unprotected sex and I have never gotten preggers. I've used plan B before, but not every time, and even statistically, on birth control you'd think it'd at least happen once in 7 years of being sexually active and not 100% sexually protective. But now, even if I did get pregnant, I likely wouldn't survive the pregnancy. My diabetes is a bitch to control, my hormones even controlled make it go wild. I'd have to get an abortion, because I don't think or trust my body to survive that. This utuerus isn't even safe for me to have, why would it be safe for a child? It kills me saying this. Writing it all out and admitting that I spent years of my life convinced all the pain was worth it. Now every period is a new agony. It's an agony knowing it's not worth it. Years of pain, hot flashes, cramps that rival contractions, and now three different doctors have all recommended hysterectomies to me. I've been friends with older women, childfree, who had endometriosis, not even diabetes and PCOS just endometriosis and they say it was the best decision they ever made. It tears me up, but I know it's what would improve my life. Going through a period is hell. If I miss a single pill, bam bleeding. Bam cramps. Hot flash! cramps, irritable, anger, frustration. The hysterectomy doesn't tear me up, but facing the reality that I will never get pregnant on my terms or be able to be healthy with it is frustrating. I reacted to this by becoming as masculine as possible. It's only now I've come to terms that I may lose the possibility of pregnancy that I've accepted being feminine. Three doctors. I need to find a new ob/gyn who will do this to me, and I just don't know what to do. It's hard enough to find a doctor who will do this to a 40 year old. Why should it be like this? Why should I be reminded every month that my body can't do what I always wanted? Who do I talk to? How do I get them to listen? Can I ask them to let me keep my ovaries? The last doctor said to take out my uterus but to leave my ovaries, as they aren't too bad now (the cysts are less than there was before). I would have to keep taking hormones but I'd no longer bleed. I'd no longer have to fear the off-chance they're wrong and I get pregnant and then die. I don't know. I'm tired. I want to not be in pain for most of the month. I want to live my life. I want..."

I trust him and I know he’s not going to do anything.\n\nHe has this one ex who he dated for only a month almost a year ago. \n\nHis ex first texted him a while after we got together, they texted for a bit and he told her he has a thing with me (we weren’t official yet) but not in a way she got the hint. Afterwards he blocked her and they didn’t talk for a while, that was more than half a year ago.\n\nTwo months ago she texted him again through her friend’s account (because she’s blocked everywhere) and asked him for closure. He talked with her a bit and told her he’s taken (we were official so he literally wrote her he’s in a happy, healthy relationship) then blocked her again and her friend’s account and asked her not to contact him again. \n\nA few days ago she texted him AGAIN, now being more bold and telling him she’s still in her mind. We once joked about sending her a picture of us the next time she texts, but I didn’t feel comfortable with that because I thought it’d be super insensitive.\n\nHis ex had a complicated life and she suffers from multiple mental illnesses, so I’m being more sensitive about it but still, I get sick to the stomach when it happens. I’m very insecure about myself and I’m trying my best to be the best girlfriend and I can’t help but think she’s so much better than me. I struggle with expressing and talking about how I feel and the fact she just can say it through text makes me feel horrible that I can’t. I can’t be affectionate as she is and she might’ve been a better partner than I am. I literally have these thoughts everytime it happens despite knowing my boyfriend loves me and that he’s not going anywhere. And it makes me feel like a bad gf and a horrible person. \n\nHe told me about everytime she texted him and showed me the conversation before deleting him saying he wants her out of her life and regrets the relationship with her, so it’s not his fault that I’m super insecure and get panic attacks everytime it happens. I literally feel sick to my stomach and can’t eat anything and I feel like it impacts me too much and I don’t know what to do. Any advice?"

    "body": "I just suddenly felt overwhelmed and needed to rant about this concept me and many other women out there probably feel as well. \n\nI don’t even know how it came to be, or how I even came to this conclusion, but I remember in middle school, I started to think the reason my crushes never liked me was because I wasn’t pretty enough. Everyone was going through puberty at that time and I was expecting my breasts and everything to grow in like everyone else, or even like the women I saw on TV. Unfortunately, my genetics didn’t get that far, so I’ll be forever sitting at an A cup with a body like an upside down triangle. I started to become so appearance obsessed and make assumptions that all men wanted were women who were attractive and pretty, nothing more. In high school it got even worse, as all my friends started to get guys asking them out and getting boyfriends when I was stuck feeling socially anxious and alone. I started asking myself what it was they had and I didn’t, and of course I ended up thinking it was my physical attractiveness.\n\nFrom that point on I developed body dysmorphia. I would cry about my ugliness and disgust for myself alone at night. I hated myself. I would switch back and forth for wanting to be thinner or wanting to be curvy. My weight fluctuated between starving myself and binge eating junk food. \n\nI’ve become better, but even now, 6 years later, I can’t help but place all my value in my appearance. I spend so much money in cosmetics and clothing, thinking I’ll get hired for being pretty (pretty privilege) or that I’ll make more friends simply for being more attractive. I think that if I were a certain level of attractiveness, maybe I would get cat-called so much more like other women talk about. But all of these concepts contradict my beliefs in attractiveness not being as important in others - it’s just myself. \n\nI don’t think about other things I have to offer as person. I don’t even think I have anything to offer. I think my personality is weak and boring. All I’m ever focused on is how pretty I am because that’s all everyone, especially men, seem to care about. I hate this cycle and I hate everything I’m perpetuating, but I don’t know how to get out of this. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for listening."

During a department meeting today about our \"Master Schedule\" for upcoming projects, my direct supervisor made a comment about my reproductive age and asked me if I had any plans of getting pregnant, as it would take a considerable about of time to plan around and he wanted know ASAP. I thought this was wildly inappropriate. (a little background- I am married, but currently have no intention on having a child in the near future- not that it's any of my colleagues' business)\n\nI was caught off guard, but I immediately felt deep shame and embarrassment over such a flippant remark simply because I am of \"reproductive age\". (28).  Everyone in the room sort of went silent but it was awkward and it made me feel so angry because I work with other engineers in my age group and I know damn well they are not receiving the same lecture because they are men. I was so taken aback that I sort of just mumbled a response about not having any plans on that matter, but now that I'm sitting back at my desk I am mortified and wish I could have thought of something better to say like, \"I have an IUD but I'll be sure to notify you when it's removed!!!!\"\n\nDo you think I should let this go?  Do I go to HR?  Is this even a big deal? It just made me feel like a liability instead of a capable employee and it has been incredibly frustrating to articulate my feelings into words on this matter.\n\nUPDATE EDIT: Hello everyone, thank you so much for all of the advice and anecdotes, the outpouring really made me have more confidence in my feelings, which I often times downplay because I do not want to be accused of being overly emotional or inferior to my mostly male colleagues.  I talked privately via phone with my boss who is off-site at a project and then to a conference tomorrow.  I told him I wanted to speak with him about how I felt the \"Master Schedule\" meeting went and that I needed to address some issues with him.  He agreed to speak with me person to person, first thing Monday morning.  I hate to have this stew all weekend, but I didn't want to go into details on the phone. He also suggested that a third party be present, because even though he didn't directly say it, I think he knows why I want to talk to him. I also contacted the ombudsperson at my institution, and they took my report, the attendance list of the meeting, and offered to facilitate a 1:1 meeting and suggested that if I am still not satisfied with the results, I can go to HR.  So, I will take the weekend to breathe deep and write down exactly what I want to say and how. I appreciate all of the feedback, navigating a career can be difficult, but I am not going to let this one incident keep me from being in the role that I love and worked so hard to achieve in the first place.

    "body": "I wanted to make this post because I am in a lot of pain after things ended with a girl I had been seeing for a few months\n\nFor context, I dated a lot in college but was emotionally unavailable during that time due to early childhood trauma and being on SSRIs and ADHD medication my whole life. I never really learned to feel feelings until I went off meds after college. I also got Lyme disease after college and didn’t date from 24-29 because of it. So I had never truly opened my heart to someone until I got off meds, treated my Lyme, and did a ton of work in therapy.\n\nFast forward to March 24’ - I met this beautiful girl through a mutual friend and we went on a few dates and hit it off pretty well. I invited her over for dinner on the second date and cooked her a really lovely meal which she enjoyed! We had been flirting over text prior and it seemed like we were both of the mind that physical intimacy was on the table that night, but I didn’t plan to have sex because I wanted to take it slower. We made it to the bedroom and she informed me that she had an STD, to which I didn’t really know how to respond. We were both drunk at that point and I got excited, ignored my original intentions, and tried to have sex anyway without really asking her about her condition, which was not smart I realize. I struggle with ED and even though I didn’t intend to have sex with her, I was able to get it up so I figured “oh shit I have to act on this moment, but as I was about to engage, I couldn’t and I mentioned I got “thrown off” by her comment and we decided to just cuddle instead. I followed up with her the next day and tried to be as much of a gentleman as I could, explaining that it takes a while for me to be vulnerable and I wanted to take it slower with her, but I had a lapse in judgement that night. \n\nWe ended up going on a few more dates and finally engaging in physical intimacy. She also told me at one point after the STD mixup that she liked being single.\n\nAfter our fourth date, I started being more intentional with her - being more forward about seeing her, and dropping in nice comments into what was mostly sexual banter between us. She didn’t respond well to that, even noting that one of my nice comments “was the worst thing I’ve ever said”.\n\nCome the fifth date, she is super distant and even says to me “I’m going to ghost you after this”, and made it clear that she didn’t want me to meet her friends either. After that date I followed up with her to explain how I was feeling, and we decided to move on.\n\nI can’t help but feel like I was “fuck-zoned” and thrown away by this girl who I really fell for, and in the end she was super unkind to me. Our mutual friend told me from the start that he was worried about how she might treat me, but I ignored him because I was smitten with her.\n\nThis was two weeks ago and I am still in a ton of pain. I wanted to post this here to try and get a feminine perspective on the situation. Thank you!"

I have already talked to a friend who will let me stay in his house for 2 months while I continue to work and save up money. I realize I have a car payment/insurance, two cats and a cell phone bill that I will need to pay at least three months in advance. \nThis is the hardest decision I have ever made, but I need advice and encouragement. \nI assume I will be able to do my online  courses from abroad. \nIs there anything I should prepare for?\n\nMy next steps include. Telling my landlord about this plan ( he wont' be happy)\n\nAnd telling my boss I need a month off of work. ( A very feasible possibility)\n\nPacking up all my stuff \n\nAnd then ulitimately leaving my daughter for 30 days while I do what I need to do in order to discover what will make me happy\n\nI mainly want to know how to use my cell phone. I called my Us cell company. I have a galaxy s7. I was told about how expensive it can be. So I thought maybe I could just maintain that line..while getting a rental? Or possibly even buy a phone card?\n\nMy next dilemma is where I'm going to go or stay. As a smaller female.. I am scared for my safety but right now .. I just want to take that risk to see Rome  and also travel to France as well. I thought about couch surfing. Are country to country flights cheaper within Europe? Any advice is very much appreciated. Leaving my daughter is so hard for me to do. She is the only one I have in my life. My mother is not  there for my and my father is dead. But i'm so depressed I feel I HAVE to do  this to make myself happy. "

Yes, a cat. \n\nAnd no, it's not about his and his wife's young dog they can't seem to handle but don't want to be taken care of somebody else for a few hours /s.\n\nBut the main reason is, my mother's husband (my parents divorced when I was three years old) is an asshole and my dad \"just can't cope being around someone who said bad things about him.\" To be clear, they never had an open conflict. It was just my brother who told my dad my \"stepdad\" talked shit about him.\n\nYeah, dad. \n\nI faced my abuser who molested me from age 8 to 12 every single day and had to pretend I'm totally fine with him being around for at least 20 years.\n\nThis abuser happens to be my brother.\n\nI am told to face my bully who happens to be my step sisters boyfriend at christmas, because he changed and am told to get \"over the past\".\n\nSo my dad asked \"I hope it's not too bad that we're not coming.\" with a shaky voice. And I inititally thought \"poor dad, it's okay, don't cry, it's just my birthday\".\n\nBut instead I said \"I accept your decision but I am not going to pretend that I'm not sad.\"\n\nHe started to complain, said things about the relationship with my mom and so on...I interrupted him and said:\n\"I don't wanna hear these old stories. I accept your decision, but I don't understand it. You said you want to be honest, so am I. I am very sad. We both have to live with that.\"\n\nI feel like I'm overreacting. My life has always been about my depressive and alcoholic mom and my brother, who is a drug addict now and seems to make me responsible for his miserable life, because I \"apparently asked for it\" when I was young.\n\nI'm done with this shit. I'm not saying \"Everything is fine, I understand\" anymore. Maybe I'm unreasonable and unfair towards my dad. But I'm hurt that after two years without being able to attend my birthday, he won't be coming. \n\nI'm just done being understanding towards everyone in this family while spending time with me is treated like a task.\n\nI'm sorry if this post doesn't fit the sub and also if it is kinda hard to read, english is not my first language. There happened a lot more in my family which I cannot write down in one posting. I just needed to vent. Maybe someone can understand.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you everyone for replying.

    "body": "I don’t know if this is the right space to ask this but I really need help, so I am a 14F (9th grade) and there is this person who works at my school, i’m not really sure what she works as but i mostly see her in the deans office half of the time. When i was walking to class, she asked if i needed a bra, I told her no and that they made me uncomfortable so I don’t wear them as much. She kept pressing about it and said that she looked at my breasts yesterday but didn’t say anything. I was very uncomfortable at the fact that a grown woman was staring at my breasts two times in a row, She told me that she’ll get me one knowing that I told her specifically that they just made me uncomfortable and I don’t wear them as much. There’s no dress code for this or anything, just don’t wear anything inappropriate basically. I was wearing a black shirt that covered basically everything and I don’t do anything to pull attention to my chest area. so, another day comes  and it’s really embarrassing because she literally put bras on her computer and called me over to her computer when there’s people in the office who can see and tell me to choose one that I would want, and she just kept pressing about this and pressing over and over again. It has overwhelmed me a lot. So, when the package arrives, she gives it to me infront of like two other students in the office and another person who works there, so i’m feeling a bit humiliated already. She tells me to try them on, I go in the bathroom and i try it on and it is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Before that, I asked her if i had to try them on because in my head i would much rather just try them on at home in a private space. She tells me yes and that she’ll love me forever if i do. I tried it on and yeah it was uncomfortable. So, I just leave the package on her desk and quickly leave because I am feeling overwhelmed and embarrassed. I didn’t leave the bra on because of how tight it was so i just put it back in the bag and left. The next day, I tell her that it was uncomfortable because she had found me in the hallway and she told me to come to her office again next Thursday to pick out another few. this has been going on for weeks and like she just won’t stop even after I show her my uncomfortableness. I told my mom about it the first time it happened and my mom agreed with her, my dad was the only one who found this weird. I asked my boyfriend what should I do and he told me that I should just deal with it. I mainly wear baggy clothing and I remember she called my mom and told her that if she noticed that I wasn’t wearing one then boys could’ve been looking at my chest too. so I have been self-conscious about my chest ever since and I don’t leave anywhere without a jacket on even in hot weather. I barely know this woman , I only spoke to her a few times throughout middle school, but it was never like being THIS comfortable with each other. she won’t stop and it has made me not want to come to school because I know that she’s going to make a comment about my breasts, because now that’s the only thing she’s even talking to me about. so I hope I’m not just being dramatic, but I really do need advice on how to navigate this because I’m very uncomfortable with this whole entire situation and I don’t know who to turn to."

    "title": "Planning to divorce my husband and need reassurance that I'm not a monster",
    "body": " \n\nI'm happy to answer questions in the comments...the gist of it is that I've (35f) been with my husband (48m) for almost 13 years, married 10. You can see that there is a significant age gap and I was VERY young (22) when we met. For a long time he was my best friend and I was head over heels in love with him, but in the last few years I've just felt...nothing. I feel no connection with him other than him being someone I mostly get along with. I want to make it clear right away that he is not a terrible person, he is not an abuser, and I don't hate him. However...I don't think he's someone I can have a future with anymore.\n\nA few (not all) of the major issues:\n\n\\- he is very irresponsible with his finances. He has no savings and tons of medical debt that he is actively ignoring.\n\n\\- his health is terrible. He has uncontrolled type 2 diabetes with his sugars typically in the high 200s - 300s. He is experiencing complications such as severe neuropathy, loss of eyesight, minor cuts turning into severe infections, etc. He almost lost his entire foot in May due to a raging staph infection stemming from a tiny cut he couldn't feel because he can't feel most of his feet. He has made no lifestyle changes in an attempt to control his diabetes and it continues to get worse. It also affects our sex life as he struggles with ED and often can't get hard.\n\nHe has also neglected his dental health to the point where he is missing most of his teeth, and the remaining teeth are broken and rotting. He is not able to afford dentures because he spends his disposable income on take-out food and items for his hobby. I knew about his teeth when we met and it was never an issue of appearance, but after 13 years of inaction I am fed up with hearing him complain and cry about it.\n\n\\- he is extremely untidy to the point of being filthy. I am not a neat freak, but I grew up in a hoarded house infested with mice and bugs, and need to keep my surroundings reasonably neat for my mental and physical health. I certainly create my own share of clutter, but I also do the majority of the cleaning: laundry, dishes, cat box, garbage and recycling, sweeping/vacuuming, changing bed sheets, cleaning the bathroom and kitchen, etc. He will occasionally do one or two of these things, and considers his weight pulled. Again...this has been happening for 13 years. We have fought, discussed, made deals, and it goes back to the same old unequal division of duties. Simply going on a cleaning strike is not an option for me.\n\n\\- We both suffer from depression and anxiety. I am diagnose with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. After ending up in the hospital in 2016 I have worked very hard to get better, and it's been mostly successful. I'm on medication and have adopted lifestyle changes that benefit my mental and physical health. My husband, after 9 years of me begging him to get help, was put on a starter dose of Prozac and stopped taking it after 2 weeks. He has not sought any kind of therapy, medical or otherwise, since then. His outlook on life is extremely negative and he feels personally victimized by any inconvenience, big or small. He is paranoid, distrustful, and feels that people in general are terrible. He relocated from his home town to live with me and has made no local friends in the 12 years he's lived here. My friends have, after a decade, stopped trying to invite him to things or include him in plans because 99% of the time he declines. He is now convinced that they all hate him, which is not true. I see my friends regularly and will go on trips without him, which upsets him but he also won't come with.\n\nI guess my issue is that despite all of this, he's not a bad person and I know he loves me in some capacity, but at this point I feel that I can't grow as a person or accomplish my goals when having to deal with the things he refuses to deal with. I don't want to be widowed at 40. I don't want to have to take care of someone due to their blatant self-neglect. I have health issues of my own that I am being VERY pro-active about and the divide just seems to get bigger and bigger. I also can't continue doing the lion's share of maintaining a home, physically or mentally. I need someone who is a true partner, and I don't have that in him anymore."

    "title": "Abusive ex hacked into old dating profile and is baiting men to harass me. Terrified and alone.",
    "body": " When I was 19 and fresh out of inpatient treatment, I met a 25 year old man on Okay Cupid. I wasn't in a place to date him seriously, as I was transitioning from having no control at all (treatment) to finally figuring myself out. However, he pressured me again and again to date exclusively, and we ended up in a two year, horribly abusive relationship. \n\nThe first red flag:  one of the first times I spent the night, after passing out drunk, he took my phone and went through all my texts. A male friend texted me. In the morning, he threatened to kick me out. \n\nThis set a precedent for the rest of our relationship; he systematically found any social media account I had ever had, read what he wanted into my email and texts (male friends texting me; e-mails from photographers asking if I was comfortable with nudes) and would harass me about the information found afterward. When I say harass, I mean unending verbally abusive texts about me being a slut, untrustworthy etc, him never being able to trust me again. Calls and calls and calls. Unending. When I once told him I was changing all my passwords, he told me that was unacceptable because he \"needed\" them in order for me to prove I was loyal to him. \n\nI never cheated once. Not after he fucked me multiple times while I was passed out (I remember waking up in bed next to my best friend to him thrusting inside of me). Not after he shamed me for my clothes, telling me I was eliciting too much male attention with this shirt. That dress. Those shoes. Not after reducing me to only my sex. Not after shaking me and intimidating me during our arguments. \n\nAnd then it came. Two years, a horrible eating disorder, shattered self-esteem later...we broke up. I thought I could finally rest and order myself together like I've honestly needed to since I was 19. Nope. Last night, he broke into an old dating site of mine. He swept through everything. He texted me non-stop about what I whore I was. Said he was glad to know he was right all along, that I wasn't to be trusted and I betrayed him. Note: every message sent on that dating profile occurred after our break up. Further note: his betrayal refers to us talking about how we would use the time a part to work on ourselves and become healthier people. A part of that was not pursuing anyone romantically (though no mentions of sexually). I wasn't pursuing anyone. I have very low self-esteem and when I am alone I use online men to validate what I perceive to be a disgusting, unloveable girl.\n\nHe has locked me out of it so I can't delete it. I have been getting increasingly sexual text messages from men I don't know all day. I am afraid he is impersonating me and baiting them into harassing me. I am so overwhelmed. \n\nOn top of this, I have a severe eating disorder and social anxiety, which our two years together only made worse (i.e. him reducing me to only the sex I was or was not having). I feel worthless. I feel afraid, of him, and of his words - what if he's right and I really am just a whore? I honestly don't know what to do. \n"

I'm getting married in 5 months, and she is constantly on me about my weight and my 99 lb sister has also started a little too, albeit more gently. My own father even told me I could stand to \"lose a few pounds\" and my mom even cried when she saw me in my wedding dress, not because I was beautiful or grown up, but because I had \"gained so much weight.\" My wedding dress is a size four and fits me perfectly. I've always had body image issues (wonder why lol) so I have been trying to practice body love and list out things I do like about myself, and this morning was feeling pretty good about my body. I casually remarked that I'm skinny and my mom immediatly retorted \"you aren't skinny. You aren't fat, either, but you're definitely not skinny.\" Then she plays the victim when I get upset and says I'm \"too sensitive.\" Our family dynamic is very involved, so I can't just walk away without being guilted by everybody in my family and breaking my mom's heart, because she honestly believes she's helping me. I have tried everything and am at my wit's end here. I'm afraid I won't feel beautiful in my wedding because of the constant put-downs. I can't bring this up with my fiancé either, because he is already about to tell my family off, which would alienate us both because my family is very traditional.

I know that sounds super wimpy, to say the most painful thing I've ever experienced is a pap smear. But it was awful. I cried hysterically the whole time, was literally screaming in pain. It felt like I was being stabbed with a knife in my vagina. My results were normal, so that was good. But I honestly felt traumatized from it. I know that sounds silly. \n\nAfter that, I refused to get another one. Almost seven years have passed since my first one. I turn 25 next month. \n\nJust recently I had my first appointment with a new doctor, a woman (last one was a man, and he *was* a great doctor, I don't hold the pap experience against him.

    "body": "I've been dating my boyfriend, M, for a little over a year now, and we have a really strong relationship, and we're really serious about each other.\n\nWe're both in our late teens, about to graduate, and we still live with our parents. We skype every night to go to sleep(because we're one of those clingy couples that's with each other every second of the day), but M technically has a \"bedtime\", mostly because his parents don't want him up all night playing video games and stuff, or being loud, while they're trying to sleep. \n\nSo, M always told me his bed time was 10, and he would get back on his laptop after his parents were asleep. But it turns out, for months, he's been lying to me, his bedtime was actually 10:30, and he never payed attention to whether or not his parents were asleep when he got back on the laptop. I found out because we aren't secretive(or so I thought), and we know eachother's passwords, and often leave our stuff logged on on eachother's laptops. \n\nSo I saw his facebook. He was talking to a group of people, and during that conversation he decided he would make a gif of something. When he \"got back on\" around 11, he told me he was talking to those people(said he started talking to them when he was talking to me), and was going to make a gif. He stopped messaging me for about 10 minutes to \"make the gif\". But it was already made. He just went through the process of pretending, to hide that he was online from me. \n\nI confronted him, and I think he came clean(I don't know if he's lying about anything else), and admitted that he'd been doing stuff like this for months. \n\nBut the thing is, is he doesn't really have a reason to lie(he said he thought I would \"get mad\"), even if he wanted to be on the internet without talking to me for like an hour or something, I wouldn't care. We're clingy, but I'm not controlling. \n\nAnd also, I haven't brought it up to him because I just realized it, but a lot of the nights he couldn't \"get back on the computer\" until 12 AM - 1 AM in the morning. Which always sucked because I like going to sleep at an okay hour. He originally said he wanted an hour to himself, but a lot of times he takes 3 hours, and I don't understand.\n\nThere was no reason to lie, but he did it for months, we've also had lying as an issue before(about small things, but I would talk to him about how it's not okay, because I literally don't lie to him about anything). \n\nAnyways,  I'm sorry this is so long, but I don't know how to trust him. This is eating away at me. I already have a lot of trust issues(he's not even aware of this, because I've done nothing but 100% trust him from the start), and anxiety, and I can't focus on anything but this. He  was lying for *months*. And he didn't even have a reason to. It just makes me think, what'll happen when he does have a reason?\n\nAnyways, sorry this is so long, and thanks, if you read the whole thing... but how do I trust him again? It wasn't a huge lie, but it's so hard to get over for me.\n\n\n\nEdit; look, everyone here is down voting me and saying I need to give him space(which I do, he is the clingy one), but I was originally asking how to get over it. I know it's not a big lie, but it hurts a lot, and I love him, and don't want to doubt him. But that's all. I tried to give some backstory, but everyone's jumping on me being overly attached, but really the reason we spend so much time together is because he wants to be together every second. And while I'm not against it, I'm not the one who is not allowing alone time. If someone could please answer my original question, how do I get over him lying to me, and trust him 100% again? "

    "body": "I'll try to be as detailed as possible/try to explain as best as I can but I'm forgetful and might have to edit to elaborate.\n\nI'm in an abusive relationship; my husband is physically, sexually, mentally and financially abusive. I'm 19 years old and my husband is 30. we met and started dating when I was underage (I was 14) but I was isolated and alone, none of my family cared about me so I didn't have anyone to tell me that maybe this relationship was wrong. We got married the week I turned 18, and this January, we moved up north, close to the border of Canada, in the middle of nowhere. And I mean NOWHERE, the nearest store is 15 miles away, the hospital is even further and I'm wheelchair bound and can't drive.\n\nso I'm trapped and isolated, and I have a 3 year old son, and an 8 month old baby (both are his kids). and this week, I found out that I'm pregnant. so I'm feeling even more trapped, especially because I don't work and he makes all the money. even if I could physically leave, I have kids, I'm pregnant, I'm disabled and I didn't graduate high school so my job choices are slim to none.\n\nfor more context, I'm disabled because, over the last couple of years, he has repeatedly dislocated my hips. And, the last time he did it, when we moved, he kept me from getting medical treatment, so the bone started dying. there's no way to reverse it, just slow it down and help deal with the pain, which I can't do either because he won't let me go to physical therapy.\n\nalso, I can't go on birth control. the pill has really adverse and severe side effects, and Im very forgetful so I miss days, which negates the whole point of taking it. and this pregnancy actually happened while I was on the IUD, so even long term birth control doesn't work. I dont know why. and because I can't go on birth control, I have had multiple pregnancies, one after the other, but most have ended in miscarriage because of all the stress and physical abuse.\n\nBUT, the main reason leaving has been an option recently is because in March, my husband was diagnosed with something terminal and was told that he probably had 2 years left. 5 maybe; a 20% chance he'd make it to five years. and I dont know if I should just stay with him for the rest of his life, or if I should just leave him. it would seem cruel to leave him while he's sick, but he's not himself lately because of the medicine he takes. I managed to get a job babysitting my neighbors kids (its only 20 dollars a day but I can take my kids with me) without him noticing because he's either at work or asleep. that never would have happened before; he's always maintained a firm grip on my freedom and finances.\n\nso, like I said. I don't know if I should leave while I can or just wait it out. it seems cruel to leave. but there's always a possibility he'll make it to 5 or even 10 years, and if he continues to be as abusive as he always is (or even worse), I'll probably die from the physical abuse (he's actually nearly killed me multiple times and my throat is permanently damaged because of it).\n\nedit: the one thing I forgot to mention was that I have reported him multiple times to the police and to doctors. every time, he managed to get the police to believe him and not me, even when I was a minor. he'd purposefully hurt me in ways that looked like self injury because I have a history of depression and suicidal tendencies. he even once had me involuntarily committed to a mental hospital after I tried to leave him; he had told the doctors that I was suffering from postpartum psychosis (this was after I had my 8 month old) and they believed him because he works in the medical field.\n\nedit 2: this is a crosspost r/relationship_advice"

    "body": "To give you all the background this is going to be a long story, but your help will be most appreciated.\n\nWe are a married couple, 34 and 37 years old, with two beautifull children, almost 2 and 4 years old. We are from western Europe, but now live in Japan. We came here 1,5 years ago for my job, a big opportunity to create more security for our family, but my wife had to give up her job for my career. This is not the issue, we have been very happy for the last 18 months here, but it is important to realise that she made a great sacrifice for my career and financial security for us as a family. \n\nAfter a great holiday back home with a lot of hapiness came the shock. After not getting her period we became worried and a few days later found out that my wife was pregnant. Both her and mine initial reaction was panic. I will try to describe why we panicked. It is very expensife to have a child in Japan and even though we have some savings, they would be completely wiped out by having another child. Also it is very impractical to have 3 children in Japan, this country is not set up for large families. We both felt that the strain this would put on our family would be very big and that we would be able to offer our 2 children much less. Then I mean things like going to the park, sports lessons, music lessons and international school. Then there is the medical condition of my wife, she has chronic high blood pressure and the previous 2 pregnancies have been anything but easy. The whole generation of her father has died before the age of 45 (all 7 brothers and sisters!). Somehow this was only a concern for me and she did not take this into consideration. \n\nBoth our initial reaction was this is never going to work and that we need to have an abortion (we are from a liberal country and are not religious and she had an abortion 12 years ago when we were students). We discussed the situation and what to do for a few days and my decision tended to take an abortion. I made it clear to her at that point that thats how I felt and that I felt this way mainly because of her health. All the operational and financial issues can be solved, but i have a real fear that she will lose a few years of her life by having another baby. My biggest fear our whole marriage is losing her and being left alone with 2 children that we love dearly. I also told her that it was in the end her decision as it is her body and she would have to do all the work, whatever way we would go. Her decision was then to take an abortion, and to do it fast. So one week after finding out we were pregnant she had an abortion. This in itself was a very unpleasant experience. I could not be with her (not allowed by the clinic) and the staff only speaks Japanese, and she doesnt.\n\nNow we are 3 weeks further and the problems this has brought along are much bigger then I, and her, expected. Obviously she was very sad with what happened and the regret is very big for her now. I also have some regrets, for me the decision was something like 60/40. The problem is that her pain and sadness has taken the form of anger towards me and in a lesser extend to our whole family. She says that when she sees me, she is reminded of her loss and that she feels that I have taken something away from her. Also she can not really enjoy time with our 2 children. She still loves them and takes care of them, but she says the hapiness is gone. I really want to help her with her pain, but she will not open up to me emotionally. I am afraid if we can not get this fixed it will break us apart and we will all lose what we love most. \n\nI have many regrets now. I should have told her about my worries for her health and life before and we should have discussed about having a 3rd child much sooner. We have been really stupid not really talking about this. I feel now that it was better to keep this baby. It would have been hard, but the current threat to our hapiness is much bigger. \n\nI would really like your advice in how to deal with this situation. How can I help my wife, and how can I reestablish an emotional connection with her? If you have any more questions about our lifes or situation, please ask, I will be very open. This is a throwaway so I dont have anything to hide."

    "body": "\nSorry for this rant but I really need to get this out of me. I truely hate the way our female bodies are. I hate the fact that we are basically alive incubators. Our pelvis is designed to shit out babies. Our vagina is lubricated so the male dick can slide in. Our boobs are for feeding babies and male looks. I sometimes literally feel dirty and repulsed bc i have boobs and a vagina. I hate that every man wants to get inside me and have sex with me. And we dont even orgasm that much from PIV sex, like you give us vaginas and then we cant even come from straight sex with men? What a joke, as least mother nature blessed us with a clitoris so we can have at least some fun out of life lol. \n\nOur design isnt even that good tbh. Especially when talking about pregnancy. Human pregnancy looks like something straight up out of a horror movie. Blood splashing everwhere, the mother is in incredible pain, the baby is crying, sounds like a murder scene but naw its Just how it is. Animal mothers give birth easily. Horses literally give birth standing up, and the baby is ready to go, it walks already. Our babies require non stop attention, you Gotta watch out for their mushy ass head and it doesnt even walk until like 2 years old. And our babies are TOO BIG they tear apart our vagina and we have to get stitches. Like, we could pop out a baby size of an egg and it could grow overtime but nawww its Gotta be BIG. \n\nI also hate the way women are naturally more submissive and shy and prone to manipulation. I hate how we are more emotional. I hate how weak our bodies are. Naturally. Male bodies are made for running, being athletic, strong, they develop muscles easily, we dont. Our bodies develop FAT easily. At least in animal kingdom females and males are more so the same in size and females are strong and hunt. For example lionesses, they are the hunters, they can fight of male lions if necessary. Female horses can fight off horny males by delivering a fatal kick in the head. But we are weak, we cant fight off rapists and murderers. I hate it. At least we could have some sort of barbed wire vagina, to prevent rapists but nawwww we cant have nothing. We rely on other males to protect us bc we be too weak. And they are our natural predarors. We are like gazelles and they are the lions. We should be wary of them but instead we are attracted to them. Its crazy. The gazelles hate lions but they want to be them. Bc Lions are in charge. \n\nIdk i really am sad. Sometimes i think, what did I do to deserve this. Why am I naturally like this. I want to feel better about myself but idk what to do. I want to feel good inside my body but I Just cant. Anyone else suffering from internalized mysogyny?"

    "body": "CW: Sexual assault, men\n\nThrowaway.\n\nI don't know where to start, I'm pretty angry and sad because I thought this was *the one* (I know, I'm dumb). We were together for 7 years (HS sweethearts) and in our 20's, we lived together for 5 years and have 2 dogs. Last night I went to sleep cuddled up on him like always, everything was normal yesterday and today suddenly I got hit by the \"talk\" after lunch.\n\nSo he's always loved the idea of blowjobs but since I was his first gf he's never gotten one, because my boundaries state that I DO NOT DO BJ'S. Why? Because I was forced to give them to entire groups of boys in junior high, I was coerced, they had pictures of me naked that I sent to someone I trusted. It started out with only one guy but he brought friends once and so on and so forth. I don't really want to go into any more detail. The issue is solved, police were involved.\n\nHe knows this is what happened and the reason I don't want to give BJ's anymore, at first he was ok with this but sometimes he would slip and ask me if I'd be willing to try it, I always said no. He respected that for like 3 years until late 2019 when he asked again and I again said NO. It made me sad, I would instantly cry when he brought it up and last year was no exception even though it had been so long since the last time.\n\nToday he sat me down and asked me if I still felt this way and when I said I did he asked me to try therapy. I asked for what? I don't *need* therapy, I just want to keep penises away from my god damn face. He said this was selfish and that if I'm not willing to fix my problems with penises that we could no longer be together, then he got up and left, told me to think about it and he will be back tomorrow.\n\nHe said he read various posts online about people in unfulfilled marriages and partnerships where everyone always replied to the OP that they should dump their partners because life is too short or something to be sexually unsatisfied. I don't think this is fair, it can't be that important to want to leave me. I'll do literally anything else he asks in the bedroom except for this, how can it be a dealbreaker?? Not like I'm not having any sex at all with him.\n\nAnyhow I'm super frustrated and don't really have anyone to talk to about this, it's just too humiliating. If anyone can offer advice I'd be truly grateful. Thanks TwoX."

    "body": "About a month ago, just after christmas, I found some klonopin in a draw. I called up my best male friend at the time and told him to bring some weed over. I told him how much I was taking (around 3mg without tolerance) and he met me at my house. He forgot the weed so I instead suggested we drink. I ended up having about 10 shots of gin, and he had around 7-8. As well as this, my stupid barred out brain told me to take a bunch of Tramadol and other assorted medications, Trazadone, a pack of hayfever meds etc... (I was in a very bad place and have struggled with my mental health for a while).\n\nAnyway, as would be assumed, I blacked out after that and have literally no memory of anything- until I was riding my bike along a highway at 2am to his house (I don't know why, I think he told me to). Once I was there I realised that I was no longer in my previous outfit, and was not wearing a bra or underwear under my clothing. Asking him about it, he told me we had made out and I had given him Oral, and my clothes had been taken off.\n\nThis was especially disturbing to me as I have never ever been into him or any other man, and have identified as a lesbian since I was around 12 years old, which we talked about alot and was very very clear to him. He, on the other hand, had made uncomfortable comments in the past about how I looked, and how pretty I was etc. I then blacked out again and remember waking up in my bed. I once again questioned him about what had happened and he responded with meme-y smiley faces and a comment of \"8/10 Blowjob very good\". He also told me that he had said no at first to \"my initiation\" and then \"let it happen\". I have zero trace or memory of this happening whatsoever.\n\nFrom here, I felt very uncomfortable so I blocked him, and the next day I found a video he had recorded of me on my phone. It was him saying: \"I'm here with Glass-Session-1198, say it, say the word, 3,2,1, say consent\" to me. In the video I cannot keep my head up and cannot speak properly, but he is able to.\n\nI sent him the video and asked for an explanation, where he stated I was begging him to do stuff and he had rejected me several times before \"giving in\". Again, he watched me take several sleeves of medication and knew I was very very gay and not at all interested in him. He then claimed that I had done harm to him instead of the other way round.\n\nPS. I have stopped abusing pills, and I am underage, and so is the boy. He took me to his family christmas etc and we had sleepovers before this. I have tried my hardest to lay this situation out as bluntly as possible, as he goes to my school and seeing him makes me panic really bad. I don't know what to do and as a young girl I would really appreciate some help and advice."

The night prior I remember having one mixed drink, 2 shots, and played one round of beer pong. I know how much liquor I can handle and that was no where near the amount that makes me black out.\nWe made a beer run and got back and I noticed that this guy that I've met once before was there. Our last encounter was not very pleasant, in fact it was very strange. He got really pissed off that I didn't want to sleep with him. I tried to avoid him as much as possible. Next thing I knew I woke up next to him the next morning naked. As i was putting my clothes back on I noticed that my shoe was completely broken, the whole strap was 100% detached. \nI don't remember fucking this guy at all and that makes me so uneasy! I remember one snippet but it feels like a dream so I don't know if this actually happened or not, but I'm having flashbacks where I'm laying on my stomach and he's on top of me with his hand covering my mouth. Like I said, I don't know if that actually happened or not it feels like a dream. I feel so disgusting and violated. I came home that day and spent about an hour in the shower but I still can't stop thinking about it. \nI'm making this post because I was clearly intoxicated but I wanted to know your guys thoughts on intoxication and consent. Do you think someone who's obviously under the influence can give consent? "

    "body": "Throwaway acct. Sorry.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 10, something happened with a 13 year old family friend’s daughter. It’s only recently that I’m able to identify it as assault rather than just an early sexual experience.\n\n\n\n\nI’ll spare the details, but I will say that I thought she was cute and I just wanted to cuddle and maybe kiss. Instead, she did something unwanted and something, er, tore. I thought I had started my period but I didn’t actually get it for another three years. Yet, I also experienced my first orgasm, and she told me not to tell anyone or they would think I was gay. (Spoiler alert, I am *now*, but I didn’t want to be that then!)\n\n\n\n\nI tried to talk to my wife about this, but she just said, “well, shit happens.” I can’t blame her, because she was abused by a male relative for *years*, so what happened to me is probably just a normal childhood day for her.\n\n\n\n\nBut the thing that bothers me now is that I can’t talk about this, even with MeToo having happened. It’s seen as normal and brave for women to expose and discuss the men who assault them- but where does the LGBT community fit in? I also feel that current discourse around sexual assault tends to paint women as blameless, like victims. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo what can one do when a woman or girl *is* the predator? I even struggle with the language surrounding what happened. I can’t exactly call it rape because of the lack of, er, a penis.\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience?"

    "body": "English is not my first language so please tolerate my grammar mistakes. \n\n\nIt is a rather simple horror movie, girl was abused by her boyfriend/husband, ran away, he did everything to make her life in hell so she would go back to him. \n\n\n\nMy husband and I talk a lot when watching movies at home, the kids are sleeping, that's our chance to drink a bit and the F word, freedom time.\n\n\n\nAnyway, at the beginning of the movie, I was telling my husband “oh that's exactly what abusive people do“ “he is isolating her from her friends and family, typical“, then I suddenly realized, that's what my dad been doing to us (mom, my brother and I)!!!!\n\n\n\nSpecially she said something like, if he doesn't like what he thinks that you are thinking, he would be very upset. \n\n\n\nI almost scream and said, that's what my dad does too!\n\n\n\nI am not close to my dad, growing up he made a lot of money, we lived a pretty good life, nothing fancy. He spent a lot of money for me, for medical and schools, my health was not good when I was growing up, I love books, he let me buy a lot of books. At the same time, while we did live a somewhat privileged life, we were not allowed to go out. Going out with aunts and uncles  on a Saturday morning for a Cantonese breakfast? No, stay home, you shouldn't hang out with them, a waste of time. Going to a classmate‘s birthday party? No, well I don't mean no but you better think about it, you might regret it, you better stay home and study. \n\n\n\nThe worst was when my grandma (my mom‘s side) passed away, my brother and I were not allowed to the funeral. Why? Outside is useless, stay home. \n\n\n\nLong time ago, he asked me to “open my heart“ and told him what my dream was. He was all nice and sincere, I said I wanted to be a movie director, then his face literally changed, he yelled, said, are you a fucking moron? A director? What the fuck is wrong with you? You better think about it and come up with a better answer.\n\n\n\nThat's just an example that we were only allowed to say what he wanted to hear, or we would get yelled at.\n\n\n\nDid my mom fought back? Oh yes so many times. But dad‘s really crazy, everyone was afraid of him he would yell at us, for hours and hours, telling us how we would live a horrible life if we “only want to go out and have fun“, that we are useless because our grades are bad, that we would, again, live a horrible sad life because of bad grades. \n\n\n\n\n\nEventually we were just tolerating him. He wasn't home often, we lied to him when we go out, we were all quite at family dinner, we only talked about what he wants to listen, we didn't say anything when he yelled. \n\n\n\nHowever, at the same time, he was nice to us too. We traveled, never needed to worry about money, when I had my surgeries I got the best doctors in town, when he was happy our family had so much fun, we all watched Indiana Jones and laughed. \n\n\n\nThen I graduated from college, met my husband, dad paid for my tuition to study in America for a master‘s degree.\n\n\n\nI also label my dad as a “good dad but too controlling, bad temper“, last night watching the movie, I realized he did everything every abuser did. He isolated us from the outside, told us we are useless without him, that he is the only person that would do everything for us, we were not allowed to have our own thoughts, we were not allowed to say things he didn't like....everything, a textbook abuser."
