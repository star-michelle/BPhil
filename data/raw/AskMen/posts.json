I followed him somewhere 20 hours away from my hometown 4 years ago and the way he acts and the things he does are starting to really bother me. He doesn't seem to appreciate the fact that while I am also a student, I clean the apt and work. He doesn't work, doesn't clean. When I tell him I wish he just appreciated what I do and the fact I'm still up here he always says, \"I didn't ask you to come up here it was your choice.\" And he also says I'm his 3rd priority, now I understand that everyone has different priorities but we've been together almost 6 years. He doesn't call me beautiful or anything and when I ask like if there's something wrong he just says he thinks those things and doesn't say them aloud. Anyway, that's just a fraction but that's the general gist of what's going on. Any insight even if it's harsh would be helpful."

Every time I see something like this I tell myself that I must become this man, to become a man who is fearless, a warrior but I understand that I will probably not become a warrior. Ever since I was a child I have had this ideal to be a man. Its programmed in my brain I am constantly surrounded with the ideas of becoming a man, but they are all fictional stories.

I will be like, “yeah that’s why this wouldn’t work. I could never be with someone who thought _____,” or “yep, we’ll split the cheque. It’s been neat getting to know you but I’m not interested,” or even “ well Jesus, that’s pretty sexist / racist / homophobic of you”….\n\n… and this man will STILL believe that he is in with a chance …. simply because I am still talking to him. Like I don’t have a genuine perspective, opinions, integrity, or half a brain. I will legitimately be like “you honest to Christ believe I might still go home with you, don’t you?” And he’ll smirk and shoot back a line, and STILL act surprised and offended when I say bye at the end.\n\nLike a human man and a human woman cannot hold a conversation unless it is a prelude to sex.\n\nFor some of them, I am pretty sure I’d have to literally leave halfway through dinner or throw a drink in their face for them to accept that I am simply not interested in what they’re bringing to the table.\n\nSometimes I say “What would it legitimately take for me to convince you that I’m absolutely not interested?” Like, they’ll shoot back a like but I’ll be like, “no I’m being serious. I’ve tried everything short of outright causing a scene in the middle of this restaurant. I am GENUINELY asking you… what would I have to do for you to an actually accept and believe that I don’t want to be with you?”\n\nSo like… as someone who struggles with your run-of-the-mill insecurities, like I know all of you do too…. what is with this? Those of you with guy friends who act like this… are they like this all the time? Or just with women?  If you do this, is it just because you’re completely unsure how to deal with being politely shut down, and that’s just how you play it?

I made plans with a guy to go check out a new club but now he said he's just gonna go to a club with some other people. I dont want to go to a bar because i wont be able to drink. idk if i want to go to a club because once again i like to drink a little and get loose and thatll be kinda hard to do alone.

Would you?\n\n\n\nUPDATE: So i did end up going out alone and had a pretty good time. Basically i wen tout and saw the same people i wouldve gone out with anyway and we did the same thing ecept a few perks\n\n1.) I didnt feel like i was obligated to keep up with them and make sure they were good.\n\n2.) I could leave anytime i wanted\n\n3.) I felt a bit more confident because even though i came in alone all these groups of people were coming overing talking to me.\n\n4.) One of them did ask me for a ride and i made him pay me 20 bucks for gas. So all in all i went out for free\n\n\nONly down side was i couldnt drink. The next few days i had a few people asking me how my weekend was and what i did. I would recommend this to people as opposed to always going out in a group. Im for sure doing it more often"

Screw it. Here goes.\n\nI've been dating my S/O for about 12 months and we're getting to the stage of the relationship where we're beginning to squabble here and there. One of the sore spots in our relationship is the above: that is, I've come to find that I feel real insecure about bringing up my feelings to my girlfriend.\n\nNow, I know I'm not \"soft\" by any traditional means: I'm 6'4\" 230lbs, former college linebacker, and work as head of security for a rather large-sized building. Come from a family of hard-nosed immigrants that'd smack your head if you complained, which is why I'm having a hard time being forthcoming with my emotions.. especially being accused of being over-sensitive.\n\n**A couple of examples**:\n\n* We were out for drinks with a couple of her friends. Her friends said something along the lines of \"Yeah, you've gotta be mentally fucked in the head to join the military, the police force, or a firefighting crew. Or just really stupid.\" Now being that I have a number of friends in said occupations (and me being outspoken), I brought it up to my S/O later that I thought that was a stupid and oblivious comment to make. She then commences to say that she doesn't understand why I can't \"just get along\" with her friends and that she thinks I'm being overly-sensitive.\n* When we first started dating exclusively (yes, this monogamy was agreed upon), she said she was going to go on a \"getaway trip\" with her gay best friend, since college, one-on-one a couple hours before leaving. A little annoyed that she didn't give me the heads up earlier but whatever. She comes back and tells me that they accidentally booked at an uber-Christian B&B so she and her gay best friend had to hold hands, call each other honey, etc, in order to get a room together (they had to pretend as if they were a couple). I brought up the fact that I felt \"uncomfortable\" and she told me \"Oh my GOD are you being serious snowflake? \\[Eye roll\\]\".\n* And as of last weekend: she met my parents over dinner and afterwards, said something to the effect of \"Whew, glad that's over. Now that if I had a reason to break up with you because I didn't like your family, that's no longer a reason.\" Cue me getting tilted (\"who says shit like that\" I literally said to her) because of her behaving as if she said nothing wrong with that comment.\n\nThere are a number more anecdotes just like this.\n\nThings have been great, and she really is a wonderful person, but it's coming to the point where I feel really... **emotionally** dismissed. It's weird typing that as the person I am but that's the truest representation of how I feel. **I have brought this up** a couple of times in the past but it seems as if it's the same cycle: she either dismisses my bringing it up as over-sensitivity **or** she promises she'll change, I promise I'll communicate more tactfully, and then... I get accused of being over-sensitive one way or another a week or two later.\n\n**TL;DR**: I think I'm valid in my grievances, girlfriend shuts my feelings down and labels it over-sensitivity. Unsure how to proceed or bring it up.."

It means that until I was diagnosed and started to receive treatment, I was not absorbing most of the nutrients I needed. During elementary school, I was one of, if not the tallest in my class. Then towards the end of middle school I stopped growing and became one of the shortest. Finally during my sophomore year it started to become under control and I started gaining the nutrients I needed. So because of this, I had a delayed puberty. So now I am finally growing, currently 5'11\" and 150lbs. Yet I am self conscious about my penis size. I am about 2-2.5 inches soft and 4.5 max when erect. By now (I am currently a junior) everyone, including myself, is interested in the opposite sex and many are already having sex. I am sort of on the quiet side but still talk to girls and have joked around before. I've been talking to this one girl and she's joked about \"sucking my dick\" and I kind of joke too. While I would love to mess around with this girl whether it's just oral or full on sex, I'm just self conscious about my penis size. I don't want to sit down and explain my delayed puberty, but I'm very interested in girls and like this girl. Any help or suggestions? Is 4.5\" erect small for 17?

When we are in person we talk about everything and nothing is off limits, texting not so much. \n\nHe’s away at the moment and I’m a bit stressed out due to work and the housing market (we live apart). I told him I’d be quiet for a bit and talk to him later and his response was not a problem. \n\nIs 4 months too early too expect a deeper level of emotional support? I feel he could have at least asked if I’m alright."

Haven't officially discussed exclusivity, but for the sake of discussion and simplicity let's say we are steadily approaching that level. However... still in that fragile getting to know each other's strengths and flaws stage. This is also long distance; that could be an important fact.\n\n\nDetails of my questions:\n\nOur teams are HUGE rivals. Whenever they play each other we both talk shit; it's a lot of fun, and we love to talk about how \"taboo\" we are. Anyway, his team lost to mine last night, AT their home field, in the playoffs. I did NOT rub it in because as much as I love football, he cares way more than I do. In fact, I didn't text a single thing to him during or post game. I respect him enough to not be a douche bag about it. \n\n\nHowever now he won't talk to me. He literally told me he won't, and he is following through. At first I considered it a continuation of our running \"sleeping with the enemy\" joke, but he's taken it to a new level with punishing me for a football game... I feel ridiculous even verbalizing that this is an issue, but should I consider it a red flag in his behavior? I have no idea when he will text/call me again. He's effectively ruined my enjoyment of my teams victory by acting like a sore, salty-ass loser and I'm afraid that if I were to eventually be in a relationship with this person, this pouty behavior would be too common and cause problems. Do I tell him now that he is making me feel sad that now I can't even talk to the one person I want to? Or do I wait for him to finish licking his wounds?\n\n\nOn the other hand, am I thinking too much about it? I am prone to that, which is why I bring this question to the collective here. Thanks if you read this, I appreciate any feedback. "

We both live with our parents. She just graduated yesterday and has a job locked down and I still have a semester left plus the task of finding a job after that. Obviously the main goal right now is to move the hell out of my parents house before starting any sort of serious thing with a girl.\n\nCouple things I am worried about:\n\n- She already calls me \"babe\"--albeit via text, but that still makes me a bit nervous and shows that she may be more invested in this than I am. We haven't even kissed yet.\n\n- She wants me to come out to dinner and some bars this weekend with her \"family and friends\". Call me an asshole but I do not want to do that.\n\nHere is the issue--I like her and am sexually attracted to her, but I am 100% NOT looking for a girlfriend. On the other hand, I see no reason why we shouldn't casually date, hook up, hang out whenever.\n\nCan any guys who have started an FWB-type deal with a girl offer some advice on how to let her know that I only want something casual right now? \n\nShould I just let sex happen naturally and then have \"the talk\" the morning after? Should I take her out for coffee and tell her before anything happens?\n\nI realize that she's a grown-ass woman and can handle her shit, but I just want to go about this in a reasonable way without fucking with her emotions."

Move to another state or even country where women are OK with dating someone who looks like me (see below for my stats)?\n\nHere are some of my stats\n\n* Best physical condition of my life (hiking, taking dog out on walks, climbing)\n\n* I have all of my hair (I keep it clean)\n\n* Custom dress shirts and nice jeans are my goto outfit because I am comfortable in both\n\n* 6 ft.\n\n* Driven to a goal professionally\n\n* I am not a millionaire but I have a steady job (paying the bills) and two startups that I get some extra money for but looking to expand\n\nDisclaimers\n\n* I am half black / half white (tan) and I currently live in Minnesota\n\n* So far all women that I have asked on dates in Minnesota have so far said \"I am not their type.\" or the fun, \"Let's just be friends.\"  Most have ghosted me all together.

Start with the easiest thing and work your way up. Makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?\n\nNow I want to do the same with human beings. I want to get better at interacting with people, and to be more precise, at picking up women. But I don't know how to improve my skills. And I have no foundation to build from. Obviously, a lot of interaction and pick-up attempts and failing over and over again will lead to one getting better at it, but it's seems a bit shitty to me. When it came to weight training, I did a lot of reading before starting out to lay a solid foundation of knowledge so that I'd know beforehand what to do and not to do. And once I came around to actually starting out, I started with a low weight and worked my way up. Trying to randomly interact with people seems like a whole lot of stabbing in the dark.\n\nWhen it comes to people, I have virtually no foundation. I was a weird kid - fat, ugly and dorky so I never had many friends, and thus missed out on a lot of crucial social practice. I assume there's not gonna be much *useful* theory behind interaction because people's psyches are a lot more fickle than their muscles.

    "body": "Sorry! This post ended up being much longer than I expected, but I feel like it's all pretty important because I still have these issues/thoughts about anyone and everyone else that I'm interested in. And a lot of this sounds like you have to explain it to me like I'm a five year old, and I'd honestly prefer it if you did. I'll always be willing to look dumb in the pursuit of improvement. I'm hoping that this is just a unique enough situation to warrant this post not violating rule 4.\n\nI'm a 26 year old physically disabled guy. I have a muscular condition, which is essentially like ALS, but not AS severe in my case. Because I've been shy and anxious ever since I can remember, I never really got \"broken out of my shell\". On Tinder I've switched up the way I interact with women. In essence, I do my best to entirely ignore my anxiety and just go balls to the wall with my personality and I say things that are completely fine (likely) to say, but if I listened to my anxiety, I would never. It's working out pretty well! Fake it til you make it style.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, I still do have anxiety, and I'm even more inexperienced than you can imagine. For example, I'm not physically strong enough to do the five knuckle shuffle myself, so nudes don't really do much for me. I mean. They do, but I can't do anything about it which has led me to basically look at nudes through an artistic appreciation lens if that makes any sense. Anxiety, the no 5 knuckle shuffle, and the inexperience make me absolutely fucking awful at dirty talk. (How do you all know what they want to hear during impromptu dirty talk that you initiate?) So! I of course second guess myself a lot. Some of these questions might have painfully obvious answers, but, again, anxiety. And others aren't as obvious, but I would love to hear people's thoughts.\n\nI know that I don't look all that attractive physically to most, but I don't even care about that, because if just my looks are a deal breaker, then I consider that a dodged bullet for sure. A lot of my charm is my jokes and me being smooth. I do super well over text, but thinking about saying certain stuff in person with my limitations doesn't sound very smooth. For example, I've been talking to a girl on Tinder for a few weeks and I've told her that given the opportunity, I would love to \"tap that ass into orbit\". That was also pretty early on, she's still seemingly interested, and she lives about 40 miles away. She plans on coming here to hang out soon. Tonight I asked her to send me a wet hair selfie after her shower because \"wet hair selfies make my knees go weak\". Smooth, right? She sent me a selfie where you can tell that she meticulously showed more than she \"had\" to, but covered her nipple with her hair. I called her out in a joking/teasing way and she all but said that she was teasing me.\n\nShe's a super cool person. Super adventurous type. I asked her if she wanted to see a movie, get dinner, chill at my place or tie a skateboard to the back of my chair and cruise around Walmart and she goes \"Why not all of the above?\" which gave me a raging heart-on. She's a goofball like I am.\n\nNow. Here's where my mental block is. Being funny and smooth is my best moves besides manufactured confidence. Because of my disability, I can't really move much. So I can't really initiate anything in the most traditional ways. I have to use my words. \"Hey wanna fuck?\" or \"let me kiss you\" just doesn't...sound smooth or charming when I imagine it. Am I just too into my own head about it? Or, preferably, can you guys think of any more in character (funny/witty) ways to ask?\n\nThat's the difficult one. I seem to be doing well at knowing when someone is interested and is/or flirting. But if you guys have any thoughts on what I should look for in that area too, that would be super appreciated! Even if you feel like it's blatantly obvious, please do share still. Because besides the fake it til you make it part, I sincerely don't have any fucking clue what I'm doing even if it seems like I do. On her Tinder bio she said that she wasn't looking for anything serious, but she also deleted her account too. So even if someone isn't looking for something serious, they have the potential to find it anyway.\n\nProbably another very obvious answer, but I want to make sure from people who are far more experienced than myself. I early on mentioned tapping that ass into orbit, her profile originally said nothing serious, she sent me flirty photos, and she's going to drive 40 miles to hang out with me. Is it pretty safe to assume that she's down to have her ass tapped into orbit? That distance sucks, but I'm also definitely capable of getting to her as well.\n\nAnd just advice in general in this area would be fantastic. How to pick up girls in general. Honestly anything you can think of. Pretend I'm your son and you're teaching me how to ride a bike that I didn't even know existed.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the lengthy post! I've wondered about a lot of this for a LONG time."

She has a baby with someone else, and I have stuck by her side through everything. Because of this, she has become consistently more crabby, bitchy, and overall terrible to me. She's realized it and realized she needs to get help. She got frustrated recently and broke up with me (Sept 29th.) We had plans to meet the following Monday (Oct 6th) to talk about it. Throughout that next week she had texted me saying she still loves me, we're going to be together, she just needs some space to herself. So the 6th comes around, we talk, officially get back together and I see what looks like a hickey on her neck. She denies it by saying that her son hit her with a car and left a bruise. She promises on his life that nothing happened. I am very suspicious, but I have no reason not to believe her. A week later (Oct 13th) I was showing her something on her phone and I saw her search \"how to get rid of a hickey\" on Oct 5th, which was a day before we planned on hanging out. She denied it yet again, saying she had a friend at work who did not have internet and was looking it for her. Now too suspicious, I tell her I need some time to think about what I wanted to do. I gave her an ultimatum of either a) Confessing it, working through it and we could talk it over (complete bs, wanted a confession) or b) i would think about it and let her know what I decided.\n\nShe ultimately admitted to it. She went to a friend's house for her 21st birthday party. Apparently made out with a guy while drunk, went to the bathroom and then cried her eyes out for what she did. \n\nBasically my main question is if I would have done the same thing in her situation. I have broken up with her before, and have came very close to messing around with other girls, yet it never happened. \n\nIs it worth trying to work through it together? Or should I just move on with my life? \n\nEDIT: I guess I can add how she acted after she told me. She cried her eyes out saying it was the biggest mistake of her life. Not knowing what she had in front of her. To be honest, I am an amazing boyfriend to her and I've done anything I can for her. And she was super upset at herself, apologizing, wanted to try and work through it to which I did not want to at the time. A few days have gone by and I do miss her, but I'm not sure if this is something I could get over. \n\nSorry about the wall of text. TL;DR: Gf of 2.5 years, broke up, \"Cheated\" on me, lied, broke up with her, should I try to salvage the relationship? "

He had become so negative, lazy, undependable and started undermining me every chance he got when it came to parenting. I was so sure I was done with the relationship as he seemed unwilling to try to talk and attempt to work through our problems even though he kept saying he didn't want to break up. \n\nWell we got into a big fight in the beginning of this month and he finally opened up to me (which I know is really hard for him to do) and he told me that he's been feeling resentful towards me for a long time. He feels as though once I became a mom, I stopped being his partner. That I put all of myself into our son and our home and I don't leave anything left for him. That our relationship has become me telling him what to do and treating him more like an employee than my partner. \n\nI feel like such an arsehole. Since he told me that, it's all I can see. I was 24 when I got pregnant and once I had our son I knew I had to grow up so I kind of faked it until you make it kind of thing. It's like I hyper focused on being a mom and nothing else and of course having a kid makes it very hard to get any alone time so I must have just let our relationship fade into the background. \n\nI love this man with every part of me and I have since the moment I laid eyes on him and honestly I never intended for things to go this way so  I'm looking for any advice on ways I can make him feel like/show him I care about him and that our relationship is important to me. Or behaviors I should be changing, traditions/habits I could start so he knows I prioritize him (example could be making his favorite meal every whatever day of the month, so even if that day is a day that I'm exhausted, he knows that I still made it because I love him) \n\nI've only been able to think of things from a womans perspective so I'm hoping some of you can tell me what you would like as a man or what has your SO done to make you feel like a priority. I know what I'm asking may sound confusing but hopefully you can understand it enough Haha \n\nPlease keep in mind that he's a recovering alcoholic so nothing to do with drinking or going out to a bar ect. We've also never hired a babysitter or left our son with family so that we could have time to ourselves but I would be willing to do so if you think it would help."

I discovered these messages about 3 months ago or more.  My bf and I have been dating for almost a year now.  When I broke the news of what I read, he was out of town, not knowing I could still see the messages and I watched the conversation with his friend as he said \"SHe saw messages about us going to bang Tanya\"  and \"Idk what to do, I'm fucked.  She caught me red handed\".   He insists that it was all just guy talk and he would never cheat on me, no matter how terrible it sounds it was not 'real' talk bc that is just how \"guys talk\".  I shared the actual messages (because I took pictures of them) with my best cousin who is a guy and another guy I really trust, and they felt it was also just how guys talk.

I am able to look after them now too so my parents and siblings are doing great even though they had it just as tough.\n\nSometimes I think about how great it all is, but at the same time it all feels kind of... Bland? Like I go to work and I'm bored, come home, hang out with friends, do things - bored. It's like there's nothing really going on.\n\nWhen I think back to when things were bad it just seems more vivid. The anger and frustration and sadness was more real, but at the same time the exciting and happy bits were more real too. All that while I was striving to get where I am now, and now I'm here and it's like, is that all?\n\nSo yeah. Things are outstanding right now but I'm not feeling it. It's important to say that I'm not depressed or sad or anything  like that. It's just this weird tastelessness.\n\nIt's hard to explain and I feel like a dick for complaining about my life being too good... But I dunno its weird. Kind of feel like I am attending my bodily functions each day while spending all my money on random STUFF that I don't even want or need. No joy or sorrow. Just weird man. \n\n\nAnyone else ever experience anything like that?"

Which in my mind varies VASTLY from my naive idea that it's mostly women being danced on and giggling about the sillyness of it all.\n\nMy problem is that I'm extremely umcomfortable about the idea of him getting sexual favors even though he swears up and down he wouldn't allow it.  I know a lot of it comes down to trust, but I really need some advice because I like him a lot and don't want to be flippant in breaking up with him.  Is there is anybody out there who has made this kind of thing work?  And how did things end up?\n\nUPDATE:  Thank you everyone for your kind advice, I received a ton of great suggestions.

People like me are the small business, the local burger joint, have gone through struggles, and are genuine and easier to connect with. People with successful social lives are McDonald's, Disney, Jeff Bezos, the soulless megacorporations. They're nepo babies who were handed everything on a silver platter.

I legit told all my besties and even my mom that I’m finally going out with a guy after a 2 year long hiatus and then you do that. I was almost gonna book my Uber when you stopped replying to me and I was so heart broken when the realisation hit me that I’d been ghosted. I’d have understood if it was me who was behind you but you were the one that asked me out 4 times until I said yes, and you then you do that. It was so embarrassing and hurtful when my friends would text me “how’s it going?” because they assumed I was there. I didn’t sleep that night, I was so hurt that I cried the whole time and I’d check my phone at every buzz thinking it was you. You didn’t talk to me until the end of February and I’m mad at myself for even talking to you after you came back without even apologising. It’s just each time you text me, I automatically look at you through a negative light and over analyse everything because I can’t take you seriously at all which makes me snap at everything.”"

As a result, I hadn’t had a single relationship last long in the past few years. It makes me think there is something wrong with me as I always used to have friends. \n\nI resorted to friends after college who rarely would hit me up to chill. I’d always have to hit them up. Eventually I got booted from the group due to beef with some members. I got into a tussle with a guy for play and ended up getting hurt. I told him and he just made it seem like I was overreacting.  After that I distrusted the whole group. \n\nI ended up not keeping in touch with the group much recently. I had some close childhood friends in that group, but they’d rather chill with them than me nowadays. As soon as I sensed this, I developed some hate towards my former friends.\n\nNowadays, I get drunk and try and solve issues through text with friends. It has made me create a toxic relationship towards friends. Now I’m willing to call out friends for their fake ness as soon as shit hit the fan. I’m tired of fake friends and I’m aggressively trying to lose them.\n\nI don’t know if this is good or not. I can tell when a friend eventually turns into an acquaintance because they’d rather chill with new people and not bother keeping in touch with me. And it’s not always their fault I guess, sometimes they are so busy to reply.\n\nBut it always hits me personally. So I end up drinking a lot one night, and venting my concerned about the relationship to all these friends. But they look at me like I’m crazy and gives them more of a reason to avoid me. For instance, my friend went on a trip this past weekend, they didn’t even mention it to me. They had planned it behind my back and they didn’t even care enough to include me. I don’t even like to call them my friends because I know deep down they don’t care.\n\n The thing is that the one guy who I’m closest with, hits me up when it’s convenient for him. But he doesn’t hit me up otherwise unless I remind him. He even told me he was busy last weekend, he posts on his story chilling with a friend and his gf. But he tells me he couldn’t chill, which just makes me have trust issues. The truth is that I can’t connect with them without weed or beer so it makes me think of I’m truly their friends."

It was winter and very cold outside. \n\nPartway through dinner, I stood up, said \"excuse me\", and went and stood on the bridge over the weir and stared at the water. I was absolutely convinced everyone inside hated my guts and the only way I could think to make the anxiety go away was to jump in. Even though, rationally speaking, I know those people liked me as a person. \n\nAnyway, after about twenty freezing minutes I got my phone out and called my mother and told her frankly where I was and what I was thinking about. To her credit, she was absolutely incredible - she told me quite calmly that that would be a pretty silly thing to do (\"all that will happen is you'll get wet\") and that I should go back inside, even though I'm pretty sure she would have been shitting herself. \n\nEventually I decided she was right and I went back inside and everything was normal. Next day I signed up for counselling and now I'm in control. \n\nThe thing that gets me about the episode is how irrational it was - how totally untrue my anxiety was, but how much control it had over me. It made me resolve to fight it hard and not be in that position again. \n\nSo what's your oh shit moment?"

Got a new job, enrolled in 17 hours of classes this semester, expanding my social circles, reconnecting with old friends, breaking shitty old habits, and adopting a slew of good new ones. By any standard, I'm doing great.\n\n\nExcept I can't really get her off my mind. I stay busy. I read, I write, I hang out with people. But in the moments during the page turn, or the clicking of the mechanical pencil, or the lull in conversation during dinner, there she is. She's there after I turn off the light, there in my dreams, and I wake up in a panic wondering where I am and where she is. Literally every damn day.\n\n\nEvery victory of the last two months (and I'm indescribably proud of how many there have been) is punctuated by how proud I think she'd be. I'm trying not to dwell. I'm not dwelling, really. I'm being ambushed, and the weeks since have done nothing to decrease the sense of loss.\n\n\nI know I'm brokenhearted. I've been here before. But it doesn't seem to be getting better. What do?\n\nEDIT: I need to put my head down, stay the course, and do the hard, painful work while everything hurts anyway.\n\nI just have this sense of yet more lost time to go. I want so badly to move on with my life. The last several months of the relationship itself were so goddamn destructive and pointless, I really hate the idea of being held back still in such a fundamental way.\n\nThe past can be such a morass of regret and misery that I try to avoid considering it more than is necessary. I think what I'm so bothered by is that intellectually, I've got this thing figured out. What happened, what to do now, and whenever the time comes, a pretty solid idea of what and what not to do next time around.\n\nThe entire emotional experience is beyond my conscious control. That's cool too. That shit is basic, primitive, built into the hardware itself. Different juices squirt around in my brain and I feel different things before I've had the opportunity to even apply anything cognitive to it.\n\nIts always a choice, and I've been choosing well. The more a habit I make of it, the better position I'll be in and habits I'll have when I finally pull my head out of my ass and stop living so mechanically.

He sometimes gives me advice on how to be more masculine and stuff, but since again I don't know how to make it natural and a part of me instead of putting up an act, it feels super awkward.

After me met it was really so nice. In our first date itself, We had intimate moments (except for the deed as she had her cycle going on) and really liked every bit of it. We couldn’t wait to meet again. We met on 5th June for the first time & i told her I’ll be travelling for a month & I’ll be leaving in five days. She was so emotional & was saying stuff like “this felt so unreal, ill miss you so much, can’t wait for you to be back etc”. We were texting after the date, day and night. Then after two days i drove for an hour to see her (spontaneous plan) as she stays a bit far & we met again for 30 mins in car& really loved it too. We were so much closer to each other & felt like this shouldn’t end.. i suspected it to be infatuation as I had never seen someone get so crazy so early, so this kind of made me emotional too and i was also saying all kind of lovey dovey stuff. She was really so emotional through text on the day i was leaving and was saying i was the best thing that happened to her etc. she even was saying “i might lose interest in her & we will stop talking cause a month is really long period”, “she really hates to lose people & she is kind of attached to me” & I reassured her that nothing like this will happen and time will pass so quick and I’ll be back to her in no time. We were texting back and forth constantly and she shared a lot of things about her and was saying “i love you, i miss you etc, you’re such a good kisser etc”. She even shared that she has endometriosis and intense mood swings which make her hard to be with someone. She was getting jealous whenever i shared about my past relationships & i felt that damnn she’s just so much into me that my past is affecting her. We also had little arguments here and there & i just thought that it’s natural and happens with all girls. On various occasions she even shared that sometimes she says things she doesn’t mean and is rude. She said she doesn’t have many friends And likes to be alone etc. I told her that we’ll work through whatever happens & I’ll always be her support system. For 20 days we were constantly talking (whenever i got time) on text and calls & saying all the cute stuff to each other, she was sending me affectionate reels etc throughout and it was so good. We both were counting down days until i was back. She also told me about her past & jokingly even used to say “she’s too experienced etc” which made me think “maybe she’s very sexually liberal & easy” but i just brushed these thoughts away but somewhere developed a fear that what she may cheat on me. But i just realised these were just thoughts. We were talking on call and She literally said “she loves the way i talk and she genuinely thought we would stop talking while i was away but is so grateful we didn’t. “ .Suddenly next evening she said she’ll call me at night as she had her exams coming up, i was like okay I’ll be waiting. She didn’t call back and I called her the next day to ask if everything was alright. Her responses were cold which really made me restless as i was thinking what’s wrong as i was kind of emotionally invested in her & als as she doesn’t sound the same. I persisted in asking her but she didn’t respond nicely. Then in evening i contacted her again by double texting on a different medium (whatsapp) and she texted “dude i have other things in life too”. I was shocked cause it felt so odd to hear this from her mouth as she claimed to be so much in love with me. At this time i remembered her menstrual cycle date is near which might be causing intense mood swings which are making her like this. Next day i texted her and got to know that she failed her exam and was in a lot of stress. I told her she could have just communicated this instead of responding coldly, i would have understood the situation. We spoke about this but she was really not the same girl and sounded more practical and not like how she was the first 20 days. She said she had to go and study and disconnected the call. Next day she texted just a “hi” & i didn’t respond to that text for a day and got another text from her saying “so you’ll ignore my text cause of something i did that too cause i was having a bad day “. We spoke about it through text & i told her my side that she could have just communicated etc. we were talking and I asked her to call but she said she can’t as her head is aching and she needs to sleep. She literally said bye and slept & i was shocked as she was so different than usual. The next day night she apologised and I replied “it’s not your fault, just let me know when you feel fine”. She replied by saying “sorry I’m not good for you”. I really freaked out after getting this text as this was completely opposite of what she had been saying the previous days about how much she loves me etc. i instantly called her and asked and she said she’d..."

Its been about a month since we conversed and Where it once was texting from the start of the morning, to nothing at all. Ive tried to come to the realization that it wasnt meant to be, but this is my first time falling for someone after a divorce i had. It really messed me up psychologically. Ive tried preoccupying my time with hobbies or hanging out with other females and friends, but i really cant stop thinking about her. She really meant alot to me. Men who have been in a similar situation, how did you end up getting over this feeling of \"shittiness\"?"

I spent the first week after a drunken event feeling so shitty about myself, I honestly thought that I would never be happy again.  My regret knew no limit.  I felt I had completely ruined my life. I had betrayed my SO, my family, her family, and all the ideals I had lived up to for my entire life.   Imagine my surprise when my mind suddenly flipped from remorse to longing for another chance with “her.”  I know that it won’t happen.  I know that it CAN’T happen.  But my brain keeps thinking of it as something desirable and possible.  And to make matters worse, she is sending me messages encouraging it.  How do I get rid of this feeling?  I’m sure the ‘right’ answer is to cut her out of my life completely, but I don’t even know if that is possible.

I don't speak to my mom or immediate family because it was a very toxic environment when I was growing up. I've been abandoned, kicked out, and even just packed my shit and dipped. (This all started when I was 16)\n\nNow my backs really against the wall. I picked up a habit of smoking. And tbh I liked it. Weed just helped me. Helped me through alot. But I can't ignore the fact That through and through its been the catalyst for each and every one of my major falls.\n\nFast forward to last night. I had just enough left to roll a small J. I went outside to smoke. (Won't smoke in the house. The lady who I sublet the room from does not like any of that) Came back with the munchies and popped an instant ramen into the microwave. Here's stupid me. I forgot to add water.\n\nAfter 5 minutes I go back to the kitchen only to smell smoke. And it's everywhere. I'm lucky there wasn't a fire tbh. Immediately I open all the windows in the house. Settled the smoke, and then I started to clean everything.\n\nThis was at 3:00am so I left a note detailing what happened and that I accept full responsibility. \n\nI left for work and came back where my sublet tells me that she's sorry but she needs me to move out in a week. I understand tbh.\n\nHere's the kicker. Because of the holidays I was down off work for 2 weeks. So I had to tap into my savings just to pay rent. Now savings is exhausted. \n\nI've got no family lifelines to call and ask for a place to crash. I've been honestly contemplating just ending it. I'm tired. I have no more energy for this. Everytime I ask myself if I see myself in 2020 my body just seize up. I'm not crying, I'm not in intense emotional distress. I feel nothing. Honestly trying to see if there's a way for me to off myself, but can't do deal with the thought of putting past family and loved ones through that.\n\nTLDR: Getting kicked out in a week from my sublet. Holidays exhausted my funds. No family to go back to. Trying to rationalize ending it. "

I've been very successful in my career and that has given me somewhat of a boost in confidence.  I goto the gym and lift weights 4-5 times a week.\n\n**My problem:** I've been getting more and more depressed when I back down from situations where I should be making my voice be heard. When something happens that is bothering me, instead of speaking up I overanalylyze & rationalize my concern instead of telling the person what's on my mind. Then I get home and beat myself up over it.\n\n**Example**\nWas on the patio of a restaurant and these 2 guys were smoking and the wind was blowing the smoke into my face. Instead of telling them hey can you please move further away, I freeze up and rationalized it as well there wasn't a non smoking sign and I was almost done eating anyways to avoid confrontation.\n\nEvery time this happens, I spiral into depression for a day or two.

I'm happy to have a high sex drive but I'm aware this quick dopamine hit is affecting my ability to interact with women I find attractive to the point I'm embarrassed.\n\nNote: I know porn addiction is a relatively newly studied phenomenon and some of you will say its not a thing. Hey, that's great, I'm really happy some people are able to enjoy the content without being mentally effected. Unfortunately I have addiction issues and I don't work like that.\n\nI've been able to overcome many, many addictions but porn has been the one that I can't seem to. I tried SAA, etc. I tend to always relapse. Counselling is not helping either.\n\nI'm trying to find a medium: I want to reset my dopamine and my brain in a sense - I want to feel confident speaking to attractive women (I already gym, improved my fashion, all the stuff that most people suggest) without doing it for the sole purpose of fantasizing/hoping to get laid/being a nervous wreck. but I would ALSO like to be able to release myself. Its been 2 weeks and I'm losing my mind. Unfortunately, I don't think I have that option right now as it very quickly leads to a \"relapse\".

    "body": "Hi, I am a 39-year-old man and I feel I am still struggling to connect to my masculinity. Like most men, when I was young I wanted to grow up to become a strong man. However, throughout my life, I haven't really felt this. \n\nMy early life was difficult. My father was an alcoholic and emotionally abusive who left us when I was around 6-7 years old. He is also probably the most masculine man I have ever met (even though it's clear he has his flaws). There was no denying he was the alpha. I still have a relationship with him but only see him a few times a year.\n\nThen, on the other hand, I was raised mostly by my over-protective and fearful mother with my 2 sisters. I had very little male influence in my life growing up. Except for my uncle who came into my life as I was around 9 years old. But he was also toxic and developed an unhealthy relationship with my older sister. He would also have crazy outbursts of anger. So I have aways grown up quite fearful of men and people in general. \n\nWhen I was young I was very shy and quiet but I managed to get through school pretty much unscathed by laying low and in my teenage years by putting on a tough guy persona even though inside I was a scared pussy. I was scared of the dark until I was into my 20's. But I understood that by acting tough most people wouldn't mess with me. When I got into my later teens I would hang around with groups who were destructive and violent and I did some stuff I am not proud of. This was until I was 21 when I messed with the wrong group and it scared me so much I withdrew completely from violence and fighting. \n\nIt was about this time I started to lift weights and started to build myself up. I thought being big and jacked would make me a man. I spent about 10 years lifting and getting big but I still didn't connect to that sense of masculinity I have been seeking my whole life. Most of my life I have been promiscuous with women but have always struggled to attract high-value women. Over the last few years, I have even started to question my sexuality even though I have never found men sexually attractive. This has also caused me a lot of distress.\n\nI do also struggle to connect with other men. I can get along fine with 'beta' males. But anytime I am around a strong alpha male, I just feel fearful and struggle to be myself. I have linked this back to my early life experiences but also because I haven't been able to connect to the masculinity within myself. It's almost as though I am scared of my power and so I feel scared around other men who express their power.\n\nOn a positive note over the last 4-5 months, I have done a lot of good work on myself, I still enjoy working out but its more about the mental benefits for me now. I am quite disciplined in life and do activities that challenge me. So over these last few months, I have noticed a gradual improvement in my life. But I have come to realize that real change is slow. \n\nI do wonder if I will ever feel like a 'man' or if this sense of masculinity is even inherent within me? Or am I searching for something I will never find? Is my nature naturally more soft and feminine? Should I just accept this? Or is it a byproduct of overprotective mothering? \n\nI'm sure I am not the only one in this position. Just wondered if anyone had any advice. (My first time posting btw)\n\nThanks for reading"

I've been told I'm smart and decent looking by others. This isn't to brag, as you'll see from below I don't have much to brag about when it comes to women. \n\nI was your pretty typical \"nice guy\" in high school, was overweight and shy, until I got older lost weight and I got into a 4 year LTR. I loved her and she was good but she was also emotionally manipulative and cheated on me, I finally dumped her and haven't looked back since (this was about 3/4 of a year ago). I decided to set my standards higher now that I was older and not put up with that kind of **** again. \n\nSince then, I get a decent amount of attention from women but whenever I finally try to make a move something goes wrong. I'll give you a few examples:\n\n1) Meet a girl on OKCupid, great shared interests, seems friendly, good looking. We meet up, great chemistry, she loves it, I kiss her at the end of it and she loves it, says we should meet up again. 2 days later I text her and nothing. Text her 3 days after she tells me she's not interested in a nice way. \n\n2) Meet a great girl through mutual friends. We have a crush on each other for a few months, finally ask her out. We go out twice but both times it's very flat. No real chemistry/shared interests so it dies out.\n\n3) Meet a girl on Tinder. Smart, good looking, says she wants to see me again. Send her a text 2 days later, ignores it. \n\n4) I meet a girl in a night class. She seems very interested in me, touches me, is smiling a lot, wants to see me again. After a week of texting we go out for a drink, I walk her home and try to kiss her. She says no and I shrug it off and tell her good night. Next class she seems uncomfortable and is avoiding me. I don't push it because I don't want to seem like a creep, but I am completely confused because she was giving me flirty signals. \n\n5) Meet another girl, we hit it off. After a few days of texting we go out, I walk her home after a drink, she wants a kiss I decide to take it slow (after above experiences with kissing didn't go well) and give her a hug instead. She looks devastated and doesn't pursue it any further.\n\nThese are all in the past 3 months. Basically it seems I am fucking hopeless and I don't get why and it's really starting to affect me. I am normally confident and articulate but the constant failure is starting to grate at me, I feel destined to fail with women forever. It seems no matter what I do I always fail. \n\nWhat am I doing wrong? My friends and family all tell me I have a great personality but maybe they are just being nice. I am starting to get depressed and I don't know where to go, hence this post I guess. \n\nAny advice would be appreciated, I just don't know what to do anymore. I am not looking for pity, I just really want some help or advice or to see if anyone has gone through a similar experience. I like to analyze things and right now I just can't figure it out, the only constant here is me so what am I doing wrong? \n"

I’m so tired of not meeting anyone new, I’d love to just be able to hang out with people after class or go on dates but I don’t know how to."

    "body": "Hi,\n\nThrowaway, obviously. Recently I was given date rape drugs at a bar, and as a result ended up having sex with a very aggressive girl while completely gone. I have no memories of the event, just waking up afterwards. Obviously it wasn't forceful given that size difference etc, but it wasn't anything I would have consented to normally due to being in a relationship -- and, as a man, if any girl had been half as gone as I was then, I would never consider doing anything sexual with them. \n\nSince then, my girlfriend has broken up for me for \"cheating\" on her, and the general consensus among friends is either that I am a dick who just got wasted and cheated or that it's awesome that I had sex with an attractive girl. \n\nThis has been sort of a shitty cycle, as personally I'm embarrassed/ashamed/uncomfortable about it. Gonna talk to a therapist about it, of course, but I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation. It's tough for me to bring this up with people given that it doesn't really fit into traditional expectations of what sexual assault is, and I'm not even totally sure if that is the right way to describe it. Would just be nice to get perspectives since I don't really want to talk to people in person about this."

    "body": "I'll keep this (kind of) brief. A few years ago I married what I thought was my forever person. 3 months later I uncovered an Affair she was having with my best friend. They denied it to this day. I chose to walk away from the marriage. \nThat was 3 year ago and only in the last year have I started dating again. I had hit rock bottom and built myself back and found who I was but have some scars left over  like many big life events. I went away and got counselling and phsycology treatment for anxiety and depression.\n\nWhen I started dating again I found I was very negative and if they didn't tick the majority of boxes there was no second date. So when I met my now girlfriend it was clear this person is someone I want in my life. \n\nNow for my question. There have been some clear emotional scaring and now blackspots left over from my ex wife and the way it ended and my new girlfriend has mentioned a few time \"I don't know how to get closer to you\"  For those who have been significantly  hurt and had to learn to open up and trust again what are some trick or things your SO did to make it easier?"

    "body": "This is a longer story to read. Take it as proof that it is something that deeply troubles me, even though, after reading, some might come to the conclusion that I need not worry at all. The events I describe here happened about *18 years ago*. I can’t exactly pinpoint when it was from memory. It was roughly during the last year at school or the year after leaving highschool (or the equivalent of highschool in my country). Probably the former. I remember to have taken a riddled note of it in my diary at the time, but couldn’t find it in there. **Some exposition first** So, as young adults, me and my circle of friends (all 18-20 years old at the time) used to go to a club that was about a 30 minute drive away from where we lived. We went there almost every weekend, and a lot of times, one of our teachers from school, who we also casually hung out with sometimes on weekends, took us there in his car. If you think that’s weird, I agree, but I did not think much of it back then. And even though it’s not at the center of what I want to get off my chest in this post: behold, more on that later. One of those nights, we were there with four people, I think. Said Teacher, me, a male and a female friend. Not sure about the male friend though, maybe it was just the three of us. As usual, we partied, danced and got drunk. Somethin was different than usual. I recall the interaction with said female friend as being flirtatious that evening. It is noteworthy here that a couple of years before that we had a fling and she also was the first girl I dated and kissed, which is actually another not so cool story on its own. At the time of the events here, however, we were both in a relationship with someone else. I was in a relationship with another girl, who she was best friends with and who also was part of our social circle, yet not present that evening. She was in a relationship with another guy, and on occasion we would all hang out together. I didn’t have a crush on her or anything, but I definitely still found her very attractive, and she certainly was. She often was very flirtatious with men and had a lot of admirers / guys chasing her. I’m not saying she was a „slut“ or anything. That’s not what I mean here and that’s also not what I thought back then. What I mean is that she seemed to enjoy getting guys excited about her, or at least that is what I and some of my friends, including my girlfriend at the time, thought of her. She knew how to push the right buttons, so to say. At that time, there was also a persistent rumor that she had an affair with the teacher I mentioned, who was three times our age. It is something I never believed back then but found out many years later to be true. **How that evening went** What I know for a fact is, that evening I was getting very excited about her. I do not recall specific details as to why I felt that way, but just consider me a rather insecure 20 yo man, full of hormones and a little too much alcohol. I felt turned on by her. And I think that she was about as drunk as I was. Reflecting on it today, I have to admit it is entirely possible, that that’s what I made myself believe: that she somehow made me feel that way, that she sent signals. Maybe that was what I wanted to believe that night, wishful thinking. I don’t know. When we were on our way back, driving in the car late at night, the following happened. We were all drunk, tired and exhausted. She was in the passenger seat, and I was in the backseat, sitting behind her, while the teacher (sober, of course) was driving the car. I wanted to touch her and since I also was very insecure, I asked her if she would like me to massage her. She said yes, and so I started massaging her on the way home. We usually would not engage in such activities involving physical contact, that’s just not how we were with each other friendship-wise. It was a little step in another direction, and I had no clear goal in mind here, yet I slowly began to touch her in a more sexual way, slowly moving my hands under her shirt a little further, and further, ultimately carressing her breasts. Not in a will-nilly-let’s-go kind of way, but slowly, carefully exploring. Since I wouldn’t have wanted her to feel uncomfortable. This went on for a little while, I think. I was thinking she enjoyed it, even though it was obviously objectively hard to tell under the described circumstances. At some point I stopped and that’s it. Eventually the ride ended. Teacher dropped each of us off individually since we lived a little spread out in the area. I don’t remember who got off first and all that. So that was that. **Initial afterthoughts** I recall being very ashamed the next day. Ashamed, because I felt that with this whole thing I had cheated on my girlfriend that night (and that she had too). And in my mind, I blamed the girl for that (even though the physical thing, touching her, was clearly my own initiative). I felt like shit and swore I would never speak of this, never think about it again, and I think I just completely avoided that girl from that day on. Actually I have no memory about the times following these events. All I can say is that we never spoke about it and that over the years, everyone went different ways,..."

We basically did the same stuff as we did when together except the sex stopped like a month ago. Shortly after that i guess she started talking to some dude and took a liking to him.\n\nAt first it didn’t bother me, but then her sister showed up and it just got worse for me. Im not trying to listen, but i can hear her talking about having sex with him and thats when it started bugging me. I mean come on, we cool but I’m not trying to hear that. They talking for s couple week or a month I think then last night, she heads to meet ol’ boy with her sister, a double date or something. (Left at about 8:30 pm)\nShe shares her location with me in case some shit go down.\n4:30 am rolls around and her sister pops back at the house alone. She left her sister ALONE with some dude she practically just met at his house because she said “kick rocks” (ie: leave so i can get dicked down)\nPart of me was worried cuz i mean come on we have a young child and if he tried some shit. They’re 60 miles away. I cant do shit.\nBy 5:40 she turns off her location, I’m starting to lose it. Because why turn it off? Its not like im constantly looking at it but yeah that happened.\n\nSo basically i sit up all night. She comes back at 8:30 am. I’m upset cuz I was freaking out. No call, no text in a 12 hour time frame? Im not trying to sound sexist but it is easier for women to get _taken advantage_ than men so of course I’m upset. A full half goes by and she finally says something to me and I just said nothing. I ignored her.\nThe very sound of her voice makes me want to Hulk out, even though we havent been together or even had sex in a while but it feels like she cheated. Ironic. I feel as though that closeness we did have has been annihilated by her relations with ol’ boy. I cant even look at her sister either with whom I’ve been neutral.\n\nI don’t want her back but I think I’m envious or furious that she finally had sex with someone else after 5 years. Sounds selfish and very unbecoming of my character and I’d like some advice as how to get over it as soon as possible so Im at least able to look at her without feeling rage.\n\nI feel like a kid asking but fuck it. Thank you for any _useful_ tips.\n\nSorry it was long winded but thought you should know the story."
