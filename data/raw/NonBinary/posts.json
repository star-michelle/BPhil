If I was never able to get top surgery I’d be bummed, but I’d be able to live my life. \n\nMore and more tho I really WANT top surgery.

    "body": "I tried my first binder recently and I was mostly curious how it would feel but I ended up literally crying from the euphoria I felt when I was wearing it.  I looked in the mirror and it was like I was finally the person I was supposed to be.  I had never felt that way before and it was incredible!  But now I'm finding myself feeling dysphoric in very cute dresses that made me feel really good just a month ago.  I'm wondering if my gender changed or if my egg cracked and this is how I'm going to be now.  I still like feminine stuff like makeup and painted nails, but for some reason if I come across as very girly and cis (I am AFAB) I feel pretty bad since I started wearing my binder.  I also feel more dysphoria around my chest now and HATE seeing my boobs bounce when I walk or when I look down. Is this kind of change something that just happens when your egg cracks?  I think only time will tell but I'd be really curious what y'alls thoughts are."

I’m non-binary (agender but fine with any pronouns) but I like presenting masc and generally lean pretty heavy in that direction.

I got cold and so I went back in early. The bouncer (who hadn’t asked anything of anyone in our group coming in) chased me down to check my ID and inform me what night it was. \n\nI get it. I present way more masc than anyone else in my group. I have a beard. But I also (hope? thought?) read as pretty queer, but I don’t know if that should even matter. \n\nI walked away but it left me feeling so self-conscious and othered I ended up just going to the bathroom and texting my friends I was leaving. \n\nAs I was leaving, I quietly mentioned to the bouncer that I felt not great about the comment, and they said “I have to watch out for these girls. So whenever someone who looks masc comes through I make sure to tell them to be respectful. It’s not like I said you weren’t welcome here.”  \n\nYou didn’t have to say it. \n\nAnyways, I’ve just found myself ruminating on this whole interaction, and it’s brought up all sorts of old feelings about being an imposter in queer spaces. This was my first time going to a night like this, and I wouldn’t have ever been brave enough to go without my friends’ encouragement, but it feels like that vulnerability was met with a punch in the face. \n\nI don’t have anywhere I’m going with this, I guess I’m just feeling pretty fake.

I asked to be called a different name(let’s call it X), for a pronoun pin, and for management to enforce the name change. Half of the people I work with didn’t care and just call me X and will correct themselves if they call me my dead name. Sounds good right? Well the other half has been weird with it. \n\nThe others keep calling me my dead name and get sorta frustrated at me when I correct them. They’ll often say “well that’s not respectful for me to call you X” or they’ll ignore it. They’re older of course, all of them are in their 50s+. I didn’t expect it to go smoothly with them at first but it’s been two weeks of constant correcting and I’m tired of it. I know most of them are trying but his just annoying sometimes. And I feel bad for being annoyed at them. \n\nThe company also requires us to only wear company approved pins on our lanyard, so when I came out I asked if I could get an approved one. The request is now with the company’s legal team because “it could open up the idea for other political pins.” Dude, why is the way I want people to address me “political” but one of my managers wearing a “let’s go Brandon” bracelet isn’t?! It actually frustrates me beyond belief that they can wear that bracelet but my pin would cross the line. Now to be fair, upper management probably doesn’t know about the bracelet, but it’s still frustrating nonetheless. \n\nOverall I’m both happy and upset that I came out at work.

I'm not out at work because I live in a state that's harsh on anyone that is even remotely considered trans. However, I am in the process of a name change, for which I thank anyone at my job who uses my correct name. Usually a simple, \"Thank you for remembering my name\" because it positively reinforces them to continue. This has become something of a reflex since I don't want to angrily correct someone at my job, especially anyone in management.\n\nToday, after that reflexive statement, my nicest manager asked me, \"Are you ever going to tell us why\" I replied, \"Some of it is to heal from childhood trauma\" which is both true and my default answer to anyone I'm never coming out to. \n\n\\- I also added, \"For the other reason, I'm not at liberty to say because of our current political climate.\"  I only said this because my guard was down, as this manager is wonderfully nice to me. She's even corrected the other managers over calling me by the correct name. ... She hinted that she understood what I was talking about. She made an analogy that a bag we sell is \"blue,\" but if others found out the bag was \"blue,\" they'd gossip. I nearly cried at the level of acceptance she was giving me. Still, I asked her to keep it between us, \"I know what I just said could possibly answer why, and I ask for your digression\" She said the conversation will be kept between us. This is the first time I've ever breathed a word about being anything other than cis in my place of work. I hope it doesn't come back to haunt me. \n\nDid I fuck up? There are very little protections for trans folk in my state, even though the company I work for has a \"diversity clause\" This job is currently my only source of income. If I lose it, I'll be job hunting amidst the Covid-19 panic."

In romantic releationship I like to sweep person of their feet and to be more dominant one. I like to be the protector and I like to be physically bigger/or same size, just enough for them to craddle in for a warm hug, when they are having a bad day. In bed on the other hand, I prefer to be super cuddly, more affectionate and overall more submisive.\n\nI just know that I'm not CIS, because not a cis person feels like I do, that's pretty clear.

My paranoia and anxiety only keeps kicking in because I feel like people don’t take me seriously when I tell them my name. That’s why I’ve been considering name change, to something more “acceptable” and less “weird”.\n\nOn one hand, this feels like a safe option and this way, for example, I’d find it easier to introduce myself, without exposing myself to weirded out reactions. I think it’d also be easier to change my name if I pick something more popular and something that is more in use. But on the other hand, my partner really likes calling me Roro, and I suppose it’d be hard for them to change their habit.\n\nI’m feeling worse and worse each day, I have no idea what to do. I can also send my pics in comments if that helps."

But the other really surprised me.\n\nAs a bi-gender person, I was *really* worried about the mental effects of T on my psyche. I really like my strong female side. I was worried the whole thing would fail because the T might give me terrible dysphoria. Instead, my mind is much calmer now, more relaxed, and I'm less likely to have freaked-out thoughts that, until last week, would go round and round in my head. My other emotions are quite solid and accessible, but they're no longer ruling me with fear and anxiety (which included anxiety over starting T). My husband says he believes this anxiety was dysphoria. Perhaps he's right.\n\nSo, maybe I really am doing the right thing to explore my male side through testosterone."

(And people still get it wrong constantly, but that's a different rant)\n\nI am also open about the fact that I'm in a relationship, but often people assume that I'm a lesbian because of the way I look. So they assume my partner is either a woman or nonbinary. To be fair, this assumption isn't helped by the fact that I tend to use they/ them pronouns for my partner if I don't think his gender is relevant to the story I'm telling. My partner knows I do this and is fine with it. \n\nBut it's irritating that people think they understand everything about me based on my looks or my pronouns/gender. Like recently at work, a couple of my coworkers started talking about birth control. I had missed something one of my coworkers said, so I asked her to repeat what she said. She looked awkward and said \"well, it's not really important. We were talking about birth control, but that's not something you have to worry about.\" I must have looked confused, so she said \"because you're not risking getting pregnant\" She assumed that my partner was a cis woman. 😡 I'm not a lesbian, I'm bi. I can date anyone I want,  including the wonderful man I love! Just because I'm queer doesn't mean that you can tell my partner's gender by looking at me!\n\nIt's never good to make blatant assumptions about someone's appearance or gender. And it's frustrating to constantly have to correct people from every angle. And when I do use my partner's pronouns from the beginning, people try to force me into the \"women's role\" extra hard. Like asking if my partner ever \"helps me around the house\" or if it's mostly me who does the cooking. They assume my partner is a \"manly man\" and ask what's his favorite football team (he doesn't like football much). I just wish people didn't assume things about my gender, my partner's gender, my sexuality, the nature of my relationship, anything! Or at least didn't voice their assumptions until they got an actual confirmation from the person in question, in this case me!\n\nThis was a really big, rambling rant.

She asked why, I took a deep breathe and said \"I'm going to say things and just let me get it all out to it naturally ends\". I then explained I'm Non-binary and what that meant for me (a rejection of gender norms for 'men', more colourful fashion and sometimes outfits where if a afab was wearing the same it would be fine but also if an amab was wearing the outfit it would be fine, pronouns still fine with he/him but a definite feeling of not belonging to 'man' or 'woman' but being loved by both ends of the spectrum).\n\nWe discussed what NB looked like for us, for me socially, how open I'd be (led by me, like I'm just never telling my parents for example but may well be out at work). Her concern was if it was a stepping stone to something more like trans-woman which (quite rightly) would be a different discussion. What helped here was asking my self some tough questions like \"would medically transitioning to a woman help things?\" \"am I interested in masc / men?\", I essentially asked myself everything, so I could answer any questions my wife had. This might be just how we work but it was good to be prepared. \n\nAll in all it went well and feels so much better to be truthful once again.\n\nThank yous:\nThis sub is SO LOVING, just so so so loving.

YOU NEED TO RESPECT AND REFLECT THE VALUES OF THE COMPANY YOU REPRESENT AND INSTILL THAT IN YOUR TEAM. for him to flatly agree was just pathetic and i promptly stormed to HR, which was thankfully diverted by my beautiful and amazing lesbian coworker who understood my deep and angry \"Come with me\" as seriously as i was. she was deeply empathetic, called them assholes, calmed me down and helped me gather my shit together, and she came with me to HR with my written statement.\n\nHR took me 100% seriously. they've actually had issues before regarding other trans coworkers and will \"provide extra educational training on these topics as needed\" which is HR speak for \"ill hammer this shit into your head until you act right.\" the HR woman was floored, especially because this was during *training* so she was 100% ready to gather some informational packets and sit down with these chucklefucks for an additional hour until they're ready to be decent adults. she asked me specifically what i want out of this, i said just make it known that these topics are not a debate and reinforce that our company respects everyone and won't tolerate this blatant \"queer-phobia\" at all. i said if this happens again I will make it personal, which she completely understood.\n\ni had to then talk to my manager, because she was also going to be made aware of the issue so i wanted to beat the punch: she apologized on their behalf (not necessary), and her and i just commiserated for 20 minutes behind her closed door about the blatant misogyny, homophobia and intolerance in our male-dominated field. it was nice of her to respect my identity yet also gently try to relate with the shit we've been through because of our AGAB. she also told me she corrects everyone on my pronouns behind my back ever since she saw the \"New Faces!\" email which had my pronouns. i could have almost cried; ive NEVER had someone stand up for me like that.\n\nlater the guy who i know made the comment comes up to our dept. and asks \"who's 'Graphic Design'?\" since that's neither my coworker nor i's title (dude FUCK these men!) and we both do some design work we both raised our hands. it's obvious he was just spoken to by HR and trying to figure out who said it, and my coworker is a real one for recognizing that and raising her hand too.\n\nthey're probably too old and oblivious to see the non-binary flag on my cubicle wall, let alone know what it is, and realize it was me. because they're dumb.\n\ndumb dumbs. i should print our a bigger non-binary flag for my wall."

Self-invalidation?\n\nBut while I feel these fears, I just really wish I had a boys body, not necessarily genitals, but a boys body type. I weirdly feel like I would be more comfortable with all aspects of my gender, including my femininity, if I had a boys body. I think I would feel more free to explore my femininity too with a boys body. I’m so jealous of my guy friends bodies, especially my lanky friends. And god, I wish my shoulders were more masculine and broad. I feel like I can’t imagine myself aging into adulthood with breasts my breasts and curves, and like now since I’m young I can sorta hide my body from myself in certain ways I won’t be able to when I old. I’m afraid my dysphoria will get worse as I get older. T and maybe top surgery feel inevitable to me, but I don’t know when I should do it/am scared to. **Does anyone else relate to these feelings or have related experiences?**\n\nIt’s so weird because I also think I have some internalized enby-phobia towards myself, like “what if this is all just in my head and I *am* just being ridiculous and stupid?” But then I experience dysphoria, or maybe even gender euphoria if I’m feeling really good and secure about myself and my gender, and I’m like lol ofc this isn’t in my head this is so real. Ugh! This confusion and stuff sux so bad.\n\nOkay well thank you for reading, happy New Years everyone lmao.\n\nClaire "

    "body": "I'm not really sure where to start with this question... \n\nI'm over 30 years old and have, for the most part, always been comfortable with my assigned at birth gender (m).  I also feel like I've had an incredibly present feminine side that I love about myself. I'm very self conscious about expressing it though because of how much unwanted attention it usually gets (for instance, I really like the way I look with more feminine styled clothes/earrings/etc). Most of the unwanted attention is usually pretty harmless but leaves me feeling like I have to explain myself.  And here's the thing - I just don't even know where to begin so I do whats easy and just conform to presenting as male.\n\nFor most of my life I didn't really know much about issues surrounding gender and sexuality.  I have a penis and *mostly* like women which seemed pretty normal and expected of me, so I just never questioned my identity beyond straight-male. I didn't know I could be anything other than \"straight-male\" or \"gay-male\" or \"trans-women\".  Out of the three, straight-male seemed to fit the best, but definitely not a perfect fit... Growing up, there was always people reminding me to not wear certain things because \"those are for girls/women\", or making comments about how \"I'm sexually male, but intellectually female\" (whatever that even means).       \n\nThere's things I genuinely like about being male, but I feel like presenting completely as male paints an incomplete portrait of who I am in my heart.  I find myself wishing the people around me would just reject my gender completely but don't know how to even begin asking that of people who have known me my whole life. How do I ask my partner to do that after being together for 10 years? I don't want people to see me as a woman, because I'm not, but I also don't feel like I always relate to being a man.  \n\nI guess my question is - am I non binary if I mostly want to reject gender identity but still embrace things I like about my assigned at birth gender? Can I be born male and use they/he pronouns? Is gender even real?\n\ntl;dr not sure if I'm nonbinary or just a guy with feminine thoughts... or maybe we're all just people? Any advice or wisdom would be appreciated."

It would make me feel more confident in how I present myself if I had some background in other peoples thoughts, feelings and experiences around this.\n\nA few questions to start things off (answer any, all or none!):\n\n* Where/when do you feel safe presenting in a gender-nonconforming way? Where/when do you feel unsafe?\n* Have you ever experienced harassment/discrimination/assault because of the way you present?\n* Do you take any specific safety precautions when presenting in a gender-nonconforming way?\n* Do you ever deliberately try to \"pass\" as having a binary presentation?\n\nI know this stuff is difficult to talk about, but to my mind it's a lot better to be open about it, where we can reassure/advise/comfort each other, than to have all of us living with our own private fears and doubts.\n\nThanks for any thoughts :)"

(To be clear: They are allies of the LGBTQ+ community and love me no matter what I am, but aren't very educated in this field.) As you can imagine, this has caused a few issues, and I was hoping someone here with more experience than me could offer some advice!\n\n1) Preferred pronouns: I prefer to be referred to as they/them, but my parents still tend to refer to me by my biological sex/birth pronouns. It's more out of habit than anything else (Though my mother can't quite wrap her head around why an individual would want to refer to themselves using plural terms) but it feels quite invalidating each time. I know they mean nothing malicious, so I need a polite way to correct them!\n\n2) Changing my name: One for the software/legal experts out there. Although I think my birth name\\* is beautiful, it doesn't really fit who I am anymore (Not to mention that it's quite tied to one gender). I'm looking to change my legal name (see point 3) but haven't made a decision yet, and all my email accounts, Exam certificates etc. have my birth name on them. How can I change this?\n\n3) Gender-neutral names: This is a fun one! Since I like to present as fairly androgynous, I'm looking for a fairly gender-neutral/nonbinary name, or a name that could go 'both ways' such as Sam. Currently, I go by a temporary transition name that's a contraction of my birth name (I've had enough nicknames that most people don't question it) but it's far from ideal... my favorite idea so far is 'Tawny' (after the owl) but I'd love to hear some others so I can try on various options from a list! \n\n4)Top surgery: Ah yes, the reason I marked this as 'NSFW'. I know I need top surgery (I won't go into detail, let's just say gender dysphoria is horrible and leave it at that) but I don't know where to begin looking. (For reference, I live in the UK so ideally I'd like to find it on the NHS) Is there anything I should know, such as length of waiting lists etc?\n\n\\*I have chosen to use the term 'Birth name' rather than 'Deadname' as I actually quite like my legal name (just not as MY name!) and because it is still in use at the moment- it's dying, not dead per se."

    "body": "I'm new to the sub so sorry if I make any mistakes! \n\nI've been seeing all these posts on Tik Tok from plus size creators (I'm plus size) of \"when I hated my body I dressed like\" and it's more baggy, non-feminine, modest clothes, and then it transitions to \"verus how I dressed when I loved my body\" and it's ultra-feminine, low cut, tight, revealing clothes. \n\nThis trend specifically has really been affecting me (not the creators fault it just has). I only recently have come to realize that I don't believe I'm cis, and I was only dressing ultra feminine and revealing and such because I thought as a plus size person that was the only way I could be perceived as anything other than dirty and lazy.\n\nI only recently have started to reject that and now show no cleavage and don't wear very many tight things as it really makes me uncomfortable with how feminine I get perceived when I do so My ideal presentation is I'd say right now is fluid on the spectrum between feminine and nothing with a drop or two of masculine, never reaching either point fully but fluctuating in between and always having balance.\n\nI'm back to feeling gross and sloppy though after seeing this trend, and I wonder if anyone had any thoughts on it? I feel stuck because the way I want to dress (more feminine) doesn't match with my very \"curvy\" body, so instead I have to dress less feminine to feel more comfortable in my body, but then sometimes I think people see me as sloppy or lazy or insecure.\n\nIt's like because of my shape I wear oversized men's t shirts with bike shorts or huge pants and a high necked t shirt I tie to crop. But if I wasn't shaped this way I'd wear things like florals, or lower cut shirts (less cleavage lol) and maybe even dresss (it's been years haha) and such without feeling I'm too far on the spectrum.\n\nBut it feels like the only presentation I feel accessible it me right now makes people see me as hating myself and being lazy and dirty and to be honest ugly, as if the only way a plus size person can look desirable is through being hyper feminine\n\nAny thoughts? Can anyone relate lol? Any tips on how to deal with this? Idk this is a rant/advice mix post haha."

So I did some online shopping and it should be here soon! I'm very excited about it, and can't wait to start wearing it. I do understand that chest binding can be dangerous if not done properly, so don't worry. I bought myself a size larger than my true size, and only plan to wear it for a maximum of 6 hours or so a day, with breaks in between. I won't wear it while doing excersize or sleeping either. \n\nThe last part of the update, is I am going to book myself a hair appointment to get something that makes me feel more like myself and more confident. \n\nThat's all for now ❤\n\n- Blue Oracle"

    "body": "Apologies for this long confusing mess of ideas, but maybe some of you lovely folks can relate?\n\nI’m AFAB and have been wrestling with my gender identity over the past few months. I seem to be cycling through this process of obsessing over my gender confusion and trying to find a label that feels right, become more confused and frustrated because nothing seems to exactly fit, decide to screw all the labels and just live my life, eventually become curious about or question my gender again, and repeat. It feels like I’m spinning my wheels and going nowhere. It’s exhausting. \n\nWhile I find that many non-binary people’s experiences (particularly agender/genderfluid), resonate with me, I don’t really experience dysphoria aside from mild social discomfort in certain situations – most often when I feel I am being treated or viewed differently because I’m perceived as a woman. \n\nGenerally, I attribute this to disliking performing typical gender roles and patriarchy and all that fun stuff, but on the other hand I sometimes find myself admiring certain male physical characteristics and fantasizing about having a flatter chest or a more masculine build/physique. I’m also attracted to men/masculinity, so this can be confusing as the distinction between attraction and admiration can feel pretty murky. I actually have similar admiration vs attraction confusion towards women too, and have started exploring the idea that I may be bi. \n\nAside from the above, what leads me to suspect that I could be non-binary are:\n\n* feelings of being disconnected and apathetic towards gender or identifying with man/woman\n* Love for androgyny and gender non-conformity. I dress somewhat androgynously as I don’t shave, wear makeup, have a short haircut, and prefer loose-fitting clothing that doesn’t emphasize my chest and hips.\n* Tendency to forget that others see me as a woman and sometimes feeling genderless/gender neutral\n* Feel best when I can express myself and dress without feeling like I’m trying to present as masculine or feminine\n\nAt the same time, I don’t think I fit non-binary/trans narratives as I don’t want to change my body (I don’t even have an interest in getting a binder, wearing a sports bra feels good for me), I don’t want to change my name, and I’m cool with any pronouns. I’m also not entirely disconnected from being a woman/female as I’ve lived my whole life as one, which has undoubtedly shaped my perspective and experiences. \n\nThis leads to me believe that I’m most likely a cis woman that digs gender non-conformity and overthinks too much. I’m wary as well not to adopt marginalized identities that I don’t wholeheartedly feel that I belong to considering that I don’t share the same struggles with transition and dysphoria.\n\nI suppose I’d feel alright describing myself as agender and/or non-binary, but not transgender. Although being transgender isn’t a requirement to identify as agender/non-binary, it appears that most people who do also consider themselves to be transgender. It seems that most people assume you are transgender if you identify as a non-binary person as well. I think that I’ll end up just confusing and upsetting people by claiming to be non-binary but not trans. \n\nI’m not even sure how much I care much about being seen as non-binary by others. I honestly wonder if my desire to identify as a non-binary or queer person is more about justifying a sense of otherness that I’ve felt since forever, rather than because I truly identify with those labels. All I know is that I keep obsessing and feeling anxious over it. I just want to feel at peace with myself.\n\nI hope at least some of this made sense and if you can relate at all, I would love to hear about it!"

I was AFAB and have a strong interesting in looking more masculine in the future (when I’m in my own). I don’t any dysphoria, but I feel like I would be so much happier living with a more masculine appearance and not having to be just a woman or just a guy. \n  \n    I started watching a trans guy YouTube channel for advice and knowledge about things like binding and T. I am not transgender but I wanted to look more/feel more masculine. I’m hoping to get top surgery/ start T in the future. I was really enjoying these videos until I got to one about a Transmasculine non-binary person on Instagram. \n   \n   I have always had such a strong fear that I was just doing it “for attention” or to “be special”. Even though I have told nobody, and my parents would kill me if they ever found out. \n     \n   So I’m watching the video and the YouTuber starts saying thing like  “You HAVE to have dysphoria to transition, or else you’re just doing it for literally no reason.” “Why would you EVER change your gender and go through these things if you didn’t have significant distress with your body.” Everyone in the comments and in the video we’re making fun of them saying that transmasculine is not real, like you’re either trans or you’re cis.\n  \nI was heart broken after hearing this. All my fear of faking it and doing it for attention came back. I had to stop watching because of how upset I got. I feel even more confused now.\n \nI don’t understand why I can’t just be happy as just a girl or at least have a clear answer on who I want to be. Why I keep wanting to change myself even when I don’t have dysphoria. I just think I would be happier appearing more masculine. \nDoes anyone else feel like this?

But I got so upset and defensive if someone accidentally called me 'sir.' I even got implants when i was 21 and went from a small B cup to a D so \"it would be more obvious.\"\n\n\nAll this to say, I've had moments that make me question if I wasn't overcompensating to convince myself too? Like I've had times where I was straddling a guy just right and it looked almost as if his penis was actually mine, and it felt really good, but I've never had an issue with having a vagina. Or now, identifying as nonbinary, if I get called 'sir' I just instinctively deepen my voice a bit and go with it, and leave the interaction smiling that the other person genuinely thought I was a man.\n\n\nI'm not really sure how to feel about how I feel, and I thought that nonbinary was the right fit, but idk if it's genderfluid, or trans, or something else I don't know about? All I really know is that I like looking more like what society sees as a stereotypical man, and I like the idea of having a penis and all, but I don't hate or have a problem with the parts I have now, though I have been considering having my implants removed and maybe I would want to just have a full top surgery when I do? \n\n\nAnyway, if you made it through this whole ramble, thank you for listening and  any advice would definitely be appreciated because I genuinely have no idea what I'm feeling and I would love to be able to understand myself better."

I mean, I was always kind of androgynous but I never felt uncomfortable being called she/her, I often enjoyed presenting as more feminine, and I never had any kind of dysphoria.

I haven’t found anyone else with large breasts who are NB and am trying to figure out whether they experience dysphoria or not or what their relationship to their boobs is.

The therapist replied, \"Well, what was he supposed to tell them?\" I said he could have told them I was his partner. She said that it's difficult to be in a relationship with an \"outsider\" and often non-binary people feel best in a relationship with another non-binary person. I agree, because it is indeed difficult to come across someone cis hetero who would feel comfortable in a relationship with a non-binary person and would not try to turn that person cis. However, I know that such cases do happen. I find it very difficult to find a non-binary person who reciprocates my feelings. It is the same with LGBT people in general. I dream of a relationship with another nonbinary, but I can never find a person who also wants to be in a relationship with me. \n\nI will not elaborate on this relationship, but in the beginning it was perfect and he seemed 100% accepting of me and was not ashamed of it in front of others, that I’m nonbinary and only after some time it began to change. The breakup was painful and there were a lot of unpleasant words.  In any case, I felt deceived. I did not enter the relationship knowing that he would not accept me. I find it difficult to let go of a relationship after a long time, but I will work on this in therapy. \n\nBack on topic, I felt misunderstood when she said \"Well, what was he supposed to tell them?\". I'm a little sad now, because she hasn't heard the whole story of the relationship yet. I felt that, according to her, everything is fine with his behavior and I should not count on being treated well in a relationship, because in this world there is no place for being a nonbinary. My mother used to say similar texts to me and I also felt unimportant. I didn't expect this in a therapy session. He deceived me and it's not ok. \n\nA friend told me that the text was unprofessional and that I should talk to a therapist about it. She said she would never hide the fact that her partner is nonbinary. \n\nI just got a little disappointed, because the therapist is understanding about everything and I didn't expect her to be so opinionated. I hate the fact that I’m nonbinary. I'm starting to believe again that I'll be alone forever, and I guess I'm left with fwb relationships rather than romantic relationships. I started thinking about pretending to be someone I'm not, because it would be easier for other people, but not for me. I don't know what to think. I'll talk to the therapist about how I feel, but I'm just sad. I find it hard to believe that such an understanding and educated person could say such a thing to me.

    "body": "I'm agender (they/ them) and I normally don't care all that much about misgendering. I work a public facing job at a hotel and upset and confusion from guests makes wearing my pronoun pin complex to a degree where wearing it isn't usually worth the hassle that I will get from people.  My usual rule is if someone is going to be a recurring character in my life ie: a coworker, I will care about as much as someone getting called the wrong name, lots of patience.\nI have a coworker who we will call X for the sake of privacy. X has a lot of issues in the workplace in general, including BO so bad that the scent lingers  hours after he's left on the office chair. X doesn't lock the doors when business is low and our elevators are not keyed to a button or guest keycards. X sits in the back and plays videos and games on his phone (audio on)  for much of his shift which directly precedes mine. \nX misgenders me which is not surprising given his general lack of consideration towards his colleagues. For the most part I try to ignore X's rudeness because our shifts only intersect for 15 minutes in which he is supposed to share updates about the hotel, and doesn't, instead sitting in the back on his phone. \n\nAfter the election X got bolder. He wanted to talk to me about the election results the day of, which I did not respond to and the next shift when I was bending over the cash drawer, farted in my face on purpose. (I cannot prove this to management because the camera doesn't have sound and I basically had a non-reaction where I just walked away to the front and pinched the bridge of nose because really that moment was unreal). I sent an email because X's odor was particularly bad that day and told management that I had eye pain from the smell. \n\nRecently we had an event where a man who has been trespassed from the property for violent behavior showed up and was behaving in an intimidating manner in the lobby, which of course was left unlocked. I asked the man to leave, which of course he didn't and continued to stomp around the lobby. \n\nX misgendered me \"Dude, she told you to leave\", while I was calling security.  \n\nX then called our tresspasser nuts and left me by myself with the violent man and two guests in the lobby. The guests ended up convincing the trespasser to leave, and I locked the door. \n\nI shot off an email to our managers and GM, just said what happened, that X has never gendered me correctly and ignored my requests for correction, ignored my requests that he lock the door,  and does not pass down information, and has caused me physical discomfort with his odor. \n\nMy managers had a meeting with me yesterday and the GM gave me the book \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck\" and\njust... I'm tired of having this same sort of interpersonal issue in all of the workplaces I've been in, where people perceive me as vulnerable because I've asked for something novel to them. I thought that moving away from the Midwest to Portland would help but it hasn't really changed anything to be able to have the correct gender marker on my ID. I think that X would likely be similarly gross to any other person that he perceived as vulnerable and I'm disappointed in my gay GM for basically telling me I should expect more of the same. "

    "body": "I kinda just need to have a little vent about this and I wasn’t really sure where to do it? When I came out as Bi several years ago I had a pretty strong friend group of all bi people- all in M-F relationships. The friend group was pretty supportive but no one really did much engagement in our local queer community outside of our group. No protesting, no going to Pride, no membership in queer affinity groups (this was grad school) and no friendships with other queer people. Which is fine, but I think is important context.\n\nI noticed things were weird on a trip out of state when my best friend whose a lesbian (not from this group) was there and talking about her relationship with a woman and people became visually uncomfortable? None of them have ever been in non M-F relationships or had same-sex relationships.   Not that that in any way invalidates their sexuality. At one point one of the friends started insisting “well everyone is actually probably bi, so you never know…” and my best friend got defensive, for good reason. She said after the fact that she felt really uncomfortable and unwelcome around the group. \n\nA few months later, right before I came out as non-binary, one member of the friend group started making transphobic altright comments in my house. I started crying (it had been a bad month) and left the room. When I came back he was still going and I told him to stop. \nAfter this, a couple days later, I came out. I got some texts and an in person talk from one person that the group was upset with my reaction to his (transphobic) comments, and they all decided to end the friendships. There were a lot of other issues present that my husband has pointed out- a few of them had often lashed out at me and put me down and generally bullied me. But these were not… light friendship. We’d been in each others weddings. This was devastating.\n\nBut I’m just struck being really horrified by how the biggest queer friendgroup I’ve ever had all really seemed ok with his transphobic comments. \n\nI really didn’t expect them to end up cutting me out right after I came out. They’re the types that post for every social media protest about uplifting marginalized rights. But looking back I feel like a lot of the way they talked about their queerness felt more like an afterthought and less like I was part of a queer community that actually supported and uplifted each other. It’s just, incredibly disappointing. \n\nThat’s all, there’s no levity, just lost my friends after I came out. Buuut I told my grandma and she’s super supportive and asked me if we could do drag together because she apparently used to be a drag King in the 90s?? Who knew? A silver lining."

I don't want androgyny at the cost of my feelings of safety in my own body.\n\nBut I am not a man! And I am not a woman! And I want people to see ME before they see a man or a woman. I love being perceived. I love being in the limelight. I don't want to tone myself down and become unnoticeable just to avoid being perceived as a binary gender. I want to be seen. I want to be visible but I want to be visible without gender. I want to be seen, for once, through a lens that doesn't include people putting me in a gendered box.\n\nI truly thought being perceived 100% as a man would be less uncomfortable than being perceived 100% as a woman, but it is not. It is equally distressing. I wish people could see the human in me before categorizing me as male or female."

    "body": "My husband knows I’m NB but not many other people know. I don’t have many people in my life because I’m disabled and kind of a hermit. \n\nI have a lot of guilt over not being NB “enough”. I got married six months ago in a dress even though it didn’t really align with me. I liked the dress initially, but over time I felt weird about it. I was just so nervous to see family (mostly super religious) and old friends and to be married in front of people that I didn’t have the energy to deal with any questions on my wedding. I feel like I may have let myself down.\n\nMy husband uses my they/them pronouns but I haven’t really asked anyone else. When new people ask my pronouns I say they/them, but I’m still too embarrassed to ask my friends that I do not live near and only talk over text/calls. I have a lot of trauma from when I initially came out as bisexual to my parents. Now, because of what they said to me, it is hard for me to be myself to people for fear of being “attention seeking” and “oversharing”. Telling my parents is definitely out of the question.\n\nI also feel that because I’m afab that more binary trans people already dislike me or think that I’m attention seeking. I feel excluded. I’ve even had my breasts reduced (-10 lbs!) for mostly gender reasons. I used to wear my hair buzzed. But I still have a very feminine body and it feels like that’s all what people see.\n\nAnd on top of this I want to go on T gel for bottom growth but I’m scared that my parents will notice my voice change. Or just random people for that matter. I live in a supposedly purple state but it seems pretty republican to me. Somehow seems even more republican than the red state I lived in last. And the anti trans rhetoric rn is insane and I worry that it’s not safe to be more out. But at the same time I feel like not being out is the cowardly thing to do. I feel invalid because I haven’t socially or physically transitioned that much."

I am fortunate to work for a company that is an equal opportunity employer, has pride events, and no discrimination policies. Unfortunately this doesn’t stop coworkers from being discriminatory behind closed doors. I work in the OR. I’ve had a doctor during surgery go on a tangent of his hatred of trans people, saying they are all mentally ill, and he will refuse to recognize them by their preferred pronouns and names. He also said he wished we could segregate the LGBTQ community from the rest of society so that the cis/straight people “won’t have our lifestyles shoved down their throats”. It’s disgusting. I felt so helpless because this doctor had the power to ruin my career if I were to report him. I have no real recourse. I’ve also had other people make insensitive comments here and there, and I try to chalk it up to them simply not understanding but it seems they don’t want to even try to learn or understand. I wear a they/them badge clip. When I first started wearing it my coworkers asked me if those were my pronouns and I said yes. They proceeded to still call me she/her without even trying to call me by my preferred pronouns and have never attempted to use them. This I can live with because I’ve gone my whole life being called she/her but it would be nice to be recognized and have someone at least try to acknowledge me for me. Yesterday was the last straw. Another coworker went on a tangent about how trans people are fake and he won’t respect them. I wasn’t able to leave the room. After that I no longer feel safe being open about being non-binary. So today I’m removing my pronoun clips and just going back into the closet where my interactions with most people will be minimal aside from work. I don’t want to risk someone attacking or following me because I exist and they don’t like it."

I was rejected from the NHS 2 and a half years ago and since then I've been saving up to go private because I knew I couldn't manage waiting on the NHS all over again, potentially for them to tell me again that I'm not a real transsexual and my surgery isn't possible\n\nI was due for private surgery in South Korea on 10th May. It was cancelled a week before I was due to leave and in a really weird way by the surgeon. I've been given new dates in July, but based on the weird emails I've had it's uncertain whether it's going to happen and it doesn't even seem like I should trust the surgeon at all\n\nI've tried looking for more surgeons, even though when I was emailing around the world a year ago this was the only one who said he could do it. I found a Belgium research surgeon who has given me a consultation but I've just had back today that the waiting list for pre-op appointments is 1 and a half years... I cannot make it until then\n\nI'm so afraid about what is going to happen. I just want this to be over desperately. I'm so dysphoric and I've only just about managed the past year by having 10th May in my head as an end to transition\n\nI wish so much I was trans binary - or at least non-binary but wanting to be the opposite sex. I envy non-dysphoric trans people so much and I feel so alienated from other non-binary people because I've never met another enby with severe gender dysphoria like this. I'm scared wanting this type of surgery is just delusional. I feel like an abberration, but having neither genitals is the only way I can imagine being able to bear interacting with that area. Sorry for the tmi, but I'm so desperate to be able to be intimate with my boyfriend. I already had one relationship crash and burn last year because I was so dysphoric and I can't see how I can make this new one work for long while pre-op\n\nSoon I'll be entering my mid-twenties still stuck with the wrong kind of body, unable to do basic things most people have been doing since their teens. I can't face more years of just waiting for surgery and living this half-life. I've felt so broken and empty, literally just existing to work and make money so I can afford it, totally unable to focus on anything more mentally taxing and unable to enjoy anything.

I was androgynous before T because of untreated PCOS, so I never had a huge issue passing as male if I put a little effort in. I've been harassed and abused by partners and people who know I'm trans, but I didn't get much flak from random cis men because they used to think I'm one of them, unless they think I'm gay. Even then, it's never been this bad.\n\nEvery time I've presented as anything but a typical cis guy, I get relentlessly baraged with harassment. I don't know why. Most of them seem to want to have sex with me. I presented more femininely from 16-17 and got hit on by my dad's male friends, as well as by totally random older men. I have now officially come out as nonbinary and am dressing how I want. I already have a very distinctive appearance that I cannot change, and I have added hair dye and new clothes with different cuts and accessories to my look. I don't look or sound like a cis woman. I love my appearance now, and I'm having so much fun, but people look at me more than I want. I'm not sure if they think I'm a butch woman, a feminine man, a trans woman, or a trans man, but they know I'm queer. I've thought about making myself look masculine again, or at least dress casual, but I don't want to! I would be so sad.\n\nI had a date with a woman scheduled today. I was taking the bus, and a big guy sat beside me even though there were lots of seats. He reeked. Not of B.O., but of the same smell (?) as other people who have harassed me. He said a lot of homophobic, sexual things and pushed me. He shoved his hands in my face, and I grabbed his phone (he was trying to write slurs on his Notes app and show me) and threw it across the bus. The driver made him stand, but didn't kick him off. He kept talking about me and calling me Satanic (already got Calvinist Guilt, so thanks?), and the other people told him to shut up. He still kept going. \n\nI'm safe. I went to a café I'm familiar with, and they let me hide. There were these two very muscular people who stayed until I got into my Uber. My friends have all rallied around me.But I'm shaken and sad. I feel like giving up. I want to look how I want, but I feel like all the horrible people see me as a target. I live in a very progressive area, but I'm scared now, just as I was when I've been followed or threatened years before. I feel like I can never escape. If I don't dress in jeans and a T-shirt or something like that, I get followed and harassed and assaulted. It feels like I can't even go to my favorite fried chicken place without being stalked by scary people, or walk down the street without men calling out to me.\n\nIs there any light at the end of the tunnel? I feel awful. I feel like I'll never be safe from sexual harassment and assault as long as I live. Can I never be androgynous and happy?"

I am both the manager and a teacher there. \n\n\n\nI’ve been in the same job that I thought was a safe place for 5 years now. Two years ago, I realized I was not straight and divorced my husband. Around the same time I started realizing I am also nonbinary. Over the past two years my appearance has also started to reflect that. I have short hair and dress mostly masc. Over the past year especially (although now I’m starting to think it may have been earlier), I’ve been feeling like my boss has been trying to (slowly) push me out. But she would never directly do it, because she does value me and care about my well being. She has always invited me to spend holidays with her family Bc she has known I have never had a great relationship with mine. But she’s been more distant lately, for sure. \n\n\nThankfully those first three years I proved myself to be a huge asset to my boss and her fairly new small business. Now that the business is fully on its feet, I am less necessary. There is no where for me to grow in this job, so even if I didn’t think I was being pushed out, I have still been searching for a better paying job with more opportunities for at least the last two years (not urgently searching, but definitely searching). \n\n\nEvery interview that I have had over the last two years (around one per month ish) has ended with me feeling like it went great, the other person sounding like they wanted to hire me, and then me not getting the job. My most recent one was in a place where I knew someone who already works there, and after my interview, they told the person I know that they were impressed with my credentials and really liked me a lot. And yet, I didn’t get that job. \n\n\nToday, a coworker told me that they overheard my boss saying that she is worried about the image I give her business. \n\n\nSo I feel like I’m not welcome in the only place that’s been constant for me over the last five years. And I’m not welcome anywhere else. How am I supposed to make a living and support my family? \n\n\nIt feels like, at this point, I have to go back in the closet, grow my hair back out, present fem again, and hide my partner just so I can afford to live. \n\n\nIdk if I want advice or I’m just ranting, or maybe both. I’m just frustrated and very very broke.\n\n\nEdit to add: I forgot to mention that yesterday my boss recommended me to apply for a different position in a different location that just opened up."

I had a gyno appointment today and luckily the doctor I saw was super trans friendly and let me know I could take half the gel or take it every other day or work out something else with my doc. It was super helpful to learn that this process is gonna look different for everyone and I can work with my doc to sort this out.

    "title": "Previously CIS male dating an AFAB enby seeking advice relating to sexual acts/exploration",
    "body": "I'd like to preface this by stating that a lot of this stuff is new to me, so I apologize in advance if I say anything offensive or misuse terms, feel free to discuss any issues in the comments so I can learn more and be better.  Background: I have been a heterosexual CIS male most of my life, but have been accepting/supportive of anyone with non-hetero sexuality or relationships. I tend to be more fem leaning than most men, and am not a fan of toxic masculinity or most men in general (partially due to trauma). A few months ago I began dating an AFAB enby who I have crushed on for a long time, and it has been a bit of a transition for me in thinking and I'm still a bit insecure in my sense of self. They identify as gay and NB, and have also at times said that they are a gay boy (I recently asked for clarification on what that meant to them, and it seems they are more firmly in the middle, with some fem days and some masc days, and they see themselves more so as just gay). Rather than seeing myself as a straight male in a hetero partnership due to the parts involved, I am now seeing myself as being more so pansexual with genital preference (I'm not dating a girl, so to say I am straight would be inaccurate and potentially disrespectful to my partner's identity). I'm still trying to figure myself out in regards to all of this, and I want to do so in a way that is supportive of my partner while maintaining honest/open communication about our thoughts/feelings. I do admit that I have not been the best at communicating this stuff, and it has caused some friction in our relationship as of late. We do seem to agree on most things pertaining to our relationship and where it's headed: We both date to find a life partner, we both want to have/raise children, and we both have similar goals as far as lifestyle and living situations and more. I feel that we have way more in common than the few things we don't quite see eye to eye on so far.  There are two areas that I think are the most important to iron out that I need advice on:  The first thing is that my partner wants to be able to pursue/have relations with women. I am open to exploring this dynamic, but also don't know where my mind will end up on the subject, which I expressed to my partner early on. I'm still trying to see how I feel about this, and with it comes exploring my boundaries and challenging my own preconceptions and my own insecurities/jealousy. My partner had expressed early on that our relationship was the priority, and if I was super uncomfortable with this then they would potentially be ok with not pursuing women. Recently I have tried to express some of my thoughts/feelings relating to discomfort and boundaries, restating that I wasn't sure if this would be something I would be down with long term, which I don't feel was received or understood very well. Now my partner thinks I don't want them to do things with women and has said it's a dealbreaker, even though that wasn't what they said previously and it isn't quite what I said or how I feel. I'm not too sure how to address this or continue to safely explore this space.  The second thing is that, when my partner is feeling more like a masc gay boy, they want to fantasize about being a boy while engaging in acts that satisfy this fantasy. One outlet for this is pegging, either with their partner or with women they are engaged with sexually. I am not into butt stuff, and it makes me a bit uncomfortable. I do think I would be willing to experiment with it when I'm more comfortable with myself, but I'm just not there yet. I'm not sure if it has to do with societal programming or potentially past trauma that I may not be fully aware of, or if it makes me uncomfortable because it challenges my notions relating to sex and sexuality. Recently my partner was in a masc mood, and asked if they could top me and grind on my ass, which I agreed to try. The experience was really uncomfortable for me, both physically (it hurt my spine a bit) and mentally (I saw them as male in this situation). They were a bit aggressive/rambunctious, and were holding me down. They wanted me to fake moans and such to help them get off. I tried to express my discomfort, which was not received well. They felt like I was denying their sexuality and felt like I wasn't willing to do something focused on their pleasure. I'm not into faking things, and I didn't want to continue with a situation that made me uncomfortable. I also don't want them to feel like I don't accept them or that they can't be true to themselves around me. I feel like they aren't being understanding of me and my sexuality/preferences/comfort. I don't know how to address this either.  Tldr; My AFAB enby partner wants to see women on the side, and while I'm down to try it I'm not sure what my comfort level will be long-term. Initially they seemed to place more priority in the relationship, but now it seems like it would be a deal-breaker to them if I were to decide it wasn't for me. My partner also wants to be able to pursue masc fantasies with me and other women physically (like pegging/grinding on me) which I don't think I am comfortable with currently, at least when done to me. They feel like I am not accepting of them and that I'm going back on my word, which I..."

I feel pretty uncomfortable when they experiment with dresses and makeup and appear more feminine. But I see how happy they are and they’re a new person in a good way- which makes me really happy for them. But they’re also a new person. We went to counseling together and counselors said it’s ok if you’re straight and the relationship doesn’t work for you but I’m having a really hard time accepting that as truth. I’ve been trying for 10 months to shake this feeling of discomfort, don’t get me wrong, I could have done things a lot better but I felt like I was holding them back and hurting them because I’ve had this thought that a queer relationship doesn’t work for me, that now we’ve been separated for about 3 weeks. I feel terrible and unsatisfied because I feel like the relationship itself didn’t necessarily change and was going well.  Now I’m torn. Is it possible that I can challenge myself and this “off” feeling, this feeling of discomfort can go away? I love my partner with all my heart but I also feel like everyone around me doesn’t want me to give myself up for the relationship. Would that be considered giving up my own identity to make it work?

I’m beginning to have a much harder time embracing my nonbinary identity, and presently it’s not regular flavored transphobes I have to blame for once. if you’d like me to go into specifics I like the terms transmasc and androgyne but according to the LGBT spaces I’ve encountered more and more of online,  androgyne is ACTUALLY (/s) a “”special snowflake term”” and it’s acceptable to shame me for using it 🤨 doesn’t matter that the word’s been around for ages. apparently I make the community look like a joke by using the word. sure I might not actually be out as androgyne specifically, bUt iM sTiLL a JoKe bcus logic 😌\n\nalso, apparently it’s acceptable to be “enby skeptics” which basically just amounts to someone not believing being nonbinary is possible (because...something about brain structure and how it relates to gender?? who in blue hell actually goes as far as checking brain structure of all things when it comes to gender stuff...anyway.) but still pretending to respect nonbinary people for those sweet, sweet woke points. there are so so many of those people floating around (some of them even go to my school! it’s so fun! /s) and it’s honestly got me worried. especially because a lot of them seem to be eighteen or younger and are super quick to dismiss the words and experiences shared by older nonbinary people. maybe they’ll grow out of it, maybe not...but more and more people are speaking out about their “nonbinary skepticism” and it’s. bad.\n\ndoes anyone else have experiences in dealing with these sorts of people?? they’re like regular transphobes but Big Brained and Woke(TM) /s and it’s getting on my nerves because I don’t know how to deal. I have a small circle of people who look up to me on Instagram specifically where that crap seems to be the most heavily concentrated and it’s getting stressful having to stay strong through the onslaught of people bitching to me about how I’m oh so clearly faking my identity for oppression points. advice on coping is appreciated, or even just sharing experiences w these sorts of people. I’d like some reassurance that I’m not alone in dealing with this fuckery in the one place I’m supposed to feel supported when real life falls through.  I want to be a good role model and an inspiration to fellow LGBTQ people but now I’m questioning whether or not I should even let myself be visible at all...\n\ntl;dr: enby skeptics r annoying as hell and even with small things to help affirm my gender it’s getting hard to stay positive at the moment ://"

I don’t really have a specific label for my gender identity. Non-binary lesbian, but in general just “queer, they/them”\n\nI drown myself in as much non-binary media as I can get. I read gender theory. I’ve spent years doing intense philosophical internal exploration of *why* I identify this way, and why it’s so important to me. There is probably nothing I understand better about myself than my gender identity.\n\nBut, I still present mostly how people expect my AGAB to present. There is nothing wrong with that of course (though I don’t really want to, again, very insecure, but I’m slowly challenging it and exploring the alternative fashion I’m actually interested in). But because of it, I have a really hard time enforcing they/them pronouns. People default to my AGAB pronouns, and I usually tell them initially that it’s actually they/them. But if they don’t self enforce, I just deal with the wrong pronouns.\n\nI’ve wanted to expand to they/them/it/it’s for a few years, but I keep chickening out. Same reason. I’m really insecure about being older than most non-binary people I’ve met. It’s been six years, nothing makes me happier than being non-binary, but it’s like there is this overwhelming imposter syndrome that just won’t go away.\n\nI think most of my inability to feel valid comes from the sense that I’ll never be truly seen as valid.\n\nI’m kinda just considering going into the closet while I’m in school. But that feels like a death sentence to my identity. I feel like I’m probably going to need to professionally closet after college anyway (I’m going into architecture) if I want to stand a chance at having a career. I really want to be wrong, but I feel so fucking scared. I feel like the only way to have a normal career is to only be non-binary at home.\n\nI feel so hopeless… like I’ll never be able to be 100% openly non-binary.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for self advocacy? Any other “older” non-binary people, or those who went to college late? Anyone who has a Big Job who openly uses they/them, or even neopronouns?\n\nI’m desperate for any hope that I won’t have to feel this way forever.

It was only this year that the constant misgendering as female started affecting my mental health and making me feel worse. I read the forums and health guides for a while, consulted a doctor about it, and got a prescription for T with informed consent. \n\nMy mother flipped out. I'm an adult and should be able to make my own decisions and she knew I was genderqueer but the news I was trying to change my physical self was unbearable to her. I tried to have her talk to my doctor who told her T is relatively safe and they could monitor me for any negative health concerns of which I currently have none. She wasn't reassured and kept panicking and cried whenever I tried to talk to her. \n\nThe last straw was this week, I took my last injection from my first script and tried to make sure I had the refill bottle handy, turns out my mother stole it and the rest of my needles. I'm living with my parents so she had access to my bedroom and she stole my medication because, as she says, she \"panicked\" and \"wanted me to be safe.\"\n\nThe ONLY way I could convince her to give me my meds back without calling the police was to promise I would stop taking testosterone for a few months so we could discuss it more in depth. I understand her apprehension and worry but it's MY decision. My older brother smoked cigarettes for a very long time but she never stole his cigarettes, and she doesn't take weed away from my younger brother. But apparently medicine prescribed by a doctor to try and help my social dysphoria is off the table. \n\nI'm furious and I have no idea what to do. She gave my meds back because I promised to stop taking them for a while and taking them behind her back would make me as untrustworthy as she is, but I feel disgusting letting her manipulate what I choose to do with my own body. I immediately bought a lock box for my valuables, including the meds, because I don't fucking trust her anymore. But she saw it and feels extremely hurt that I don't trust her and I don't know how to tell her that I'm not going to apologize for hurting her feelings when she is the one who stole my property to try and control my use of prescription medication. \n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for the kind words and advice. I will try to keep it all in mind. I can't be financially independent from my folks for a while yet but it is good to know that my feelings in this situation aren't unreasonable. "

    "title": "Cishet Boyfriend Makes Questionable Remarks ",
    "body": "TW: Transphobia but no hate speech, body talk/descriptions, body comments, medical transition Hey there everyone, I was wondering if I could get some support from you lovely people about a sensitive topic (I'm using a throwaway alt account for this). I'm nearly 30, polyamorous, intersex, and am a transmasc enby guy who is dating a cishet dude who's not intersex. We'll call him Harold and he's also almost 30. Harold previous to us hooking up last year 100% identified as straight 100%. We only happened because I saw how him and our mutual friend Brian would flirtatiously joke to each other. I made a few quips, quips turned into more and then boom we ended up together. Harold hadn't been with anyone before me, ever, which was part of the reason why Harold and I started hooking up. It was supposed to be a one night stand type of thing but like countless others before us it didn't stay that way. Harold and I have been together for about a year. Early into our relationship Harold tried to keep things comfortable for me and made efforts to become educated about trans issues. Occasionally he would tell me that he was still surprised that he was gay because those thoughts had never crossed his mind before. I understand how being queer can come as a suprise and that it can be a large revelation to have. So I was chill with him saying those things early on, however I thought that things would calm down a bit. Considering as we're coming up to our one year anniversary I'd assume the shock of dating a trans guy would have worn off by now. It hasn't. I still get told I am an \"exception\", that he's suprised but happy, that I have a hot body, that he likes it when I dress in drag, that I am a bottom because he's obviously the top, that he's still kinda straight, that I will still be hot \"no matter what I do\", that he's not really gay just gay for me, and that he's worried HRT will change who I am as a person. I mentioned a few months ago that I was getting placed on an HRT waitlist after years of trying to be placed on one. I was really excited and figured Harold would be too but he just got really quiet. Still excited but not his usual bouncy golden retriever self. Then he mentioned that he was worried that HRT was going to change who I was mentally. He then gave me a little like pep talk about how it wasn't going to and that I'd still be me, and I knew the words weren't for me. They were for him. Cause HRT has been a dream of mine since I was 10; almost two decades of dreaming about finally being me fully. I know it's going to change me, I want to be changed. However that day things changed in our dynamic, at least I feel they did. He's brought up HRT and how it's going to change my body during date nights and I can hear this melancholy in his voice whenever he does. When he talks about the body hair growth, my voice deepening, the anatomy changes, I hear a sadness like he's saying goodbye to the parts that will be changed. Everything that brings me joy about the future of my transition feels like they bring him sadness and I don't know how to help him or really what to do. I know what I won't do, I won't stop transitioning medically, I won't stop wanting to be me. I can't. I also know I can't change who Harold is, and I wouldn't want to. He's funny, musical, smart, honest, great with people, and has a supportive outlook on life while also being able to have and deal with difficult conversations. He's a good guy and one of my closest friends. Recently he's started calling himself my \"boyfriend\" and seems really happy when he does. He wants to do good by me. However recently things have been changing in ways that make me feel overwhelmed. He's been spending more time with a group of his friends who are terminally online gamers. I've met them a few times but don't hangout with them because it's not my vibe or scene and they use language I don't appreciate (not towards me just in general). Last date night Harold brought up \"woke culture\" and started on a mini rant about it before I cut him off by saying that \"woke culture\" is my culture as an intersex nonbinary trans dude with dyed hair and that wanting rights and to be treated like a human being isn't a big ask and that it includes trans kids. He quietly conceded and we went about our evening. Then later on he looked at my chest and made a comment about how he is still straight vecause he liked what he saw. I am ashamed to admit I didn't call him out because I was too shocked he said that. That's not the Harold I started seeing a year ago. Even just a week before the woke culture mini rant happened we watched The Birdcage and he kept talking about how he is gay/queer and should have known it sooner. We were having a great time just being dudes who care about each other. Then it's like a switch was flipped during the week and the next date night I was met with \"you'll always be hot no matter what you do\" and \"hmm maybe I am straight\" and calling me a bottom just because I don't have the same downstairs bio gear as he does I just don't know what the hell I did or what the hell happened in the 7 days between those date nights but it's like I have mental whiplash from it. One moment he's gay the next he's saying..."

I’m dealing with a lot of imposter syndrome and need some advice. \n\nSo I’m AFAB but my whole life I’ve felt uncomfortable with womanhood in a way I couldn’t ever really put my finger on. Ever since middle school it has felt like this costume I put on to make other people happy, and I constantly feel like a “phony” girl. Sometimes the costume can be fun to play around with, but it never feels authentic. I almost get this dissociation with womanhood? Like when someone uses she/her pronouns, or refers to my body’s ability to get pregnant and perform other “womanly” functions, it’s like…I logically know you’re talking about me, but my brain doesn’t associate those things with me. In the past couple of years I’ve come to realize I don’t really feel a connection to womanhood and realized that a lot of the uncomfortable feelings I had for the past decade may have been dysphoria. \n\nAll that being said though…I can’t shake the inner critic in me that’s saying I’m deluding myself and it’s actually some other issue. What if I’m just insecure in my femininity? What if I just wanna feel special and different? It’s worth noting that I grew up in a super conservative and religious household so that probably plays a part in this. \n\nBut I guess my question is, how do y’all know the feelings you have are nonbinary feelings and not something else? How do you separate gender dysphoria/euphoria from other feelings? I’m scared to be wrong and contribute to that stereotype that being nonbinary is just a trend for confused people."

It's been going alright, but there is something that keeps irritating me:\n\nOn several occasions my partner has by default adressed me in ways you would adress a person who is the binary gender that is not my AGAB. When my partner makes me compliments, the compliments are gendered, again stereotypical compliments for the gender that is not my AGAB. \n\nEven sex has changed. While we were trying many different things in the beginning and spent a lot of time cuddling, my partner now asks specific acts from me. Those acts require me to take on a rather clear-cut role. I emulate body parts that I currently do not have. That in itself would be fine, but it kind of breaks my heart to see my partner get more pleasure out of that, than out of everything else we did before.\n\nIt feels like my partner is imagining me as a gender I am not. I am non-binary. I feel like I have a bit of all genders in me, and none at the same time. To me, non-binary does **not** mean \"the mind has binary transitioned, but the body hasn't\" or something in that order. Right now it feels like my partner treats me as \\[opposite of my AGAB\\] in the body of an \\[AGAB\\].\n\nLast week we had a small disagreement. My partner wanted to cut my hair sometime soon. But I changed my mind about it. Hairdressing is kind of a big deal for me (I'm autistic and have sensory issues with my hair). I've only had another person cut my hair once in the last 11 years. And when my partner said that I needed a more \"non-binary\" haircut, I didn't feel like it anymore. To me \"non-binary\" is not a specific look and I don't like the idea that I have to look a certain way to be seen as my gender.\n\nAnother potential problem is that my partner's friend group doesn't accept my identity. My partner is binary trans and so is most of the friendgroup. My partner told me that the friends misgender me when I'm out of earshot. And that one of the friends disliked me at first, because I \"looked too basic\" and they assumed I must be binary trans based on that. Some of them use non-binary as a label for \"non-passing\" binary trans people.\n\nI like my partner and there are many good things happening between us. But all of this is ringing my alarm bells and starting to stress me out. I tried talking about it, but it was kind of brushed off with a general \"But you know I accept you the way you are, right?\". I do have a hard time articulating what I need. But it becomes even harder to do that, when there is already an assumption in place that I need to counter.\n\nCan someone here understand this?

I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.\n\nI also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend. Whenever I'm around other women/female friends I feel uncomfortable and like I'm missing something and don't work properly as a \"woman\". Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words \"woman\" or \"girl\" to myself. I hate having \"good girl\" said to me but I like \"good boy\". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.\n\nBut I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man.

I definitely don't want to identify as \"both man and woman\", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming \"prettier\". \n\nWhat am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently. I'm also a victim of intense lifelong child abuse which may be giving me the confusion but that means I have trouble handling the idea of people being angry at me. Thanks for your patience. "

I relate with trans men a lot and their experiences, I want top surgery and stuff, but at the same time I like my chest and I’m alright with being seen as a girl. I think I’m genderfluid, but I just don’t know what I am anymore because when I get gender dysphoria it hits me like a truck. I wanna be a pretty girl, and embrace my femininity, but at the same time I also want to be seen as a boy. I feel like I’m convincing myself I’m a trans guy. I don’t know anymore. It’s stressing me out so much. I wish I could just customize myself like you can with characters in a game. I hate that I have to put a label on myself just so other people can understand me. I feel like crying. I just wanna know what I am, and if I’ll ever actually be comfortable in my body, if I’ll ever actually understand myself. \n\nSchool doesn’t help at all because I feel so out of place. I have my friends who I can go to who are all under the trans umbrella, but I just feel like they wouldn’t understand because they all found labels they were comfortable with right away. No pronouns feel comfortable, but all of them do at the same time. I don’t know what to do, it all feels like too much. "

    "title": "Agony over passport gender marker",
    "body": "I live in the US. Apologies in advance for the wall of text, I have a lot to get off my chest. I legally changed my name last spring and have updated all of my documents except my passport. I’ve been putting it off because I have no idea which gender marker to choose. I want to be one of the cool trans people who doesn’t care about gender markers or validation from government systems, but unfortunately I do care, much to my dismay. \n\n\nI have an X on my birth certificate and will have one on my DL when I eventually move to a state that allows it. In a fantasy world where transphobia doesn’t exist, I would pick X for my passport as well so all my documents match, but the reality is a lot more complicated.\n\n\nI’ve read many arguments for and against the X marker on passports, but none have made the decision any easier. I am concerned about the X outing me and causing issues abroad (both in terms of personal safety and logistics when flying or going through border control). I know I won’t be able to travel through the Dubai airport, and I have no desire to visit places where being trans is explicitly or functionally illegal.\n\n\nAt the same time, I have no idea if the danger I am worried about is real or imagined. Several countries have had the X marker for years, so this isn’t some new phenomenon that border control would have never heard of before. I’m pretty certain that TSA/border patrol/airline employees are more concerned about getting people processed quickly than they are with scrutinizing gender markers. I am also aware of the privilege regarding travel that comes with being white and a US passport holder. I am extremely unlikely to face extra scrutiny when traveling as compared to people of color and people from underdeveloped countries.\n\n\nMy other option would be to pick a binary gender. For safety reasons, the clear choice would be whichever binary gender I am likely to be read as. Right now, I’m read as female more often than male, but that is going to change. I’ve been on T for less than a year and plan on being on it for at least 2 years,  possibly my entire life. My appearance will change drastically and I have no idea how I will look a year from now, let alone 10 years when it’s time to renew again.\n\n\nThe “easy” answer is to only change my name and leave the F gender marker for now, but what if in 2 years I pass as a man most of or all of the time? That might also open me up to harassment and extra scrutiny. I also don’t want to have to update it again in a couple years and pay another 130.\n\n\nI’ve been thinking about this for close to a year now and it is eating me alive. I love traveling and haven’t been out of the country since before the pandemic. I want to be able to actually go on all the trips I’ve been dreaming about. I need to get this off my to-do list, but no option feels like the “correct” choice. There is no choice without a downside. I wish I had a wise trans elder in my life to tell me what to do, because I feel completely incapable of making this decision. \n\n\nIf anyone has made it this far and wants to share your experience traveling with an X on your passport, how you made your decision about gender markers on documents, your opinion on this situation, or just some words of encouragement, I would appreciate it immensely."

    "body": "Hello lovely enbies. I hope you're doing well. Not sure how to properly ease into this so I'm just going to dive in. I'm a somewhat closeted transmasculine non binary person. I currently live in Asia for work and present as my cis gender to make life easier for myself socially essentially. Unfortunately I plan on living in Asia for about seven more years into the future to achieve some personal life goals of mine before returning to the states where I can probably transition medically via HRT to reach a more androgynous place in presentation and potentially in mindset as well. Anyway, I would describe myself as an effeminate (trans)man. I find androgyny to be the ultimate beauty ideal and find myself drawn to androgynous people. I feel like carving a life out in society as a non binary person though can be quite difficult and confusing at times. If someone is sure of their gender, that is if they identify as a binary gender such as male or female, that will reflect in their official documents, etc, but for those of us who don't identify as a binary gender neither of them feel completely right. This is the case for me anyway. I can manage living with the gender I was assigned at birth because I enjoy effeminate things. The rest I'll have to live with and stave off dysphoria with positivity and hope for the future. As much as I want to become androgynous at times there are moments for example when I'm wearing a skirt presenting as female (as usual) and I think about the future, and transitioning and if I appear male to people having to present as male to be socially accepted and that meaning I'd likely have to wear pants or shorts and then feeling a kind of sadness over the loss of being able to openly wear skirts without fear if I have more of a masculine form. I feel like approaching androgyny from the binary female side seems easier than the binary masculine side, in that femininity has more flexibility and freedom than masculinity, at least in American society. In Asia, ironically, in comparison to America, it seems more fluid and free. Men where I live would likely be considered metrosexual in America. Anyway, back to the point. Neither male or female feels right on official documents, so which do I chose? That's difficult. Dating as a non binary person or trans person seems relatively difficult as well and is honestly another part of the reason I suppress my trans identity at times, because navigating the dating world as a cis person (correct term?) is so much easier and the dating pool seems so much larger. That's such a discouraging thing about being trans, the inevitable rejection due to your plumbing situation, which as a transman you have little control over because none of the options, at least to me, end in satisfying results. Anyway (sorry I'm all over the place I have ADHD) I also think about getting married and having kids some day. I worry about raising kids as a non binary or trans person, though our generation seems more open to such things. I also have no idea what I would wear at my wedding. A dress? A suit? And then when it comes to kids I know I'd want to get pregnant and give birth to them myself, so if I do hormones I have to consider the effects of them on my body and have to go off of them in order to have kids. It's all so complicated. I just wanted a space to vent and wondered if there were any other people out there thinking about these kinds of things. "

For some reason that seemed to help at the time.\n\nSince then I’ve struggled with the thought that I could be NB. I try to understand what it is to be NB. My ignorant take on what it means, seems to be the need to express one’s gender that doesn’t have to be with in the gender norms or can float between or be neither. I read of embies that transition which confuses my limited understanding even further.\n\nThere is definitely a part of me that has imagined being a female my entire life however I repressed these feelings for 4 decades and have begun processing these feelings for the past 2-1/2 years.\n\nI myself have been struggling so hard with my identity. I’ve been trying to grasp at identifying as NB as I wish to hold onto my marriage. My wife says she can’t be with a woman. For me however, I don’t feel that my inner turmoil is about expression. It feels more core than that. Who knows, I may just be kidding myself...I am so lost as to what my needs are but have felt that if I were NB, that perhaps that would be enough for me and a compromise that my wife could accept.\n\nSadly however, after lurking on this sub for a month, I honestly haven’t been able relate as much as say to posts on more binary targeted trans subs.\n\nI’ve spoken to my gender therapist about contemplating if I could be NB but haven’t gotten anywhere. I feel so stupid that I have such a mental block. I hope that someone can shed some light so that I can understand better. \n\nTLTR;\nBeen questioning my identity for nearly 3 years and need to better understand of what it is to be NB vs binary transgender.\n\n\nCan some of you explain what it means for you to be NB vs binary? \n\nDid any of you start by thinking you were binary then realized afterwards you are NB?\n\nIs medically transitioning atypically for NB individuals?\n\nThanks in advance and I hope I didn’t offend any  of you with my ignorance."

For context, I've only come to realize that I'm non-binary for about 4-5 months but I've always known that I don't feel aligned at all with binary gender since I was a child. Coming to terms with my gender identity is one of the happiest moments in my life and helps me grow as an individual. But as I become more and more acquainted with myself, I figure out that I may have chest dysphoria. \n\nI've recently only come to my senses of body image and body sensation because due to my past trauma of being sexual abused as a child, I dissociated with my body all the time, like it is not even there. My mental health has improved significantly from last year, giving me the chance to finally look into who I am and who I want to become. Physically presented, I lean toward the masculine side (I love having a buff and masculine body, my shoulders are wide compared to my body frame as well) and dressing androgynously but my chests always destroy that image, it stands out like a sore thumb and looking at myself in the mirror makes me feel dysphoric. I've always fancied a more man-like body to myself with a muscular chest and not the female breast and sometimes I feel so hard to breathe knowing my actual body doesn't match up to it.\n\nI've talked with my mom about this problem, she told me that whatever decision I make regarding the removal of my breasts, she will support me. But now I know I have the choice to go through surgery, I become horrified of the possibility. What if I regret it? We are talking about cutting off a part of the body. What if afterward I suffer the dysphoria in a different way and I can never take back the decision I make? These thoughts keep me up at night and I feel so suffocated. \n\nThere are moments I just know I will be better off without these breasts, when I put on my T-shirt looking at my broad shoulders when I want to be shirtless at the beach. I've already ordered a binder to see how things will go from then but I'm still really confused and scared. Can anyone give me any advice or willing to talk more about this? Should I inform my GP about this (I'm an international student studying in the UK)? \n\nThanks in advance"

I've found myself when I was 15 and I'm 23 now.  \nI never really wanted HRT. I mean, I surelly wanted to have more muscles, broader shoulders, a few stuff like that, but my voice is pretty androgenous so I don't want it to change and not a fan of going bald or having facial hair.  \nThat said, I do want top surgery and I wanted to have a hysterectomy REALLY badly. So I did. And I have no regrets. I decided to keep both my ovaries because my T levels are actually a bit higher than the standard, so, as I said, my voice is androgenous, I have hair in my body, even a few hair on my face, stuff that is really helpfull to pass as a boy sometimes (which I like), a girl sometimes and sometimes make people really confused about what I am (my favourite). My biggest goal with the hyst was stopping to have periods and being unable to get pregnant. \n\nHowever, sh\\*t happened. I now have a 5 cm cyst on my right ovary, that causes me lots of pain daily and an hemorragic cyst on my left ovary, that made me seriouslly think I was going to die because the pain was so freaking intense. I could just remove them but more than 1 doctor said it'll probably happen again if I do. When I got hyst, I already had a big one on my right ovary that was removed. I have genetic predisposition of having those damn little balls inside my ovaries. I don't want to live in pain and having to go through surgery everytime one of those shows up. So I have decided to take both ovaries out of me. And that means I'll probably need to take either estrogen or testosterone because, as you must know, a body can't really go without one of them.\n\nI'm sure as hell I don't want to take E. My round face and big hips cause me lots of dysphoria already. So I'm going for T. But I didn't want to take T either :/ I'm so f\\*cking scared of the changes I'm gonna face, specially my voice. I'm gonna take it in gel form, on a low dose, but I've seen that low dose doesn't really make little changes, it just make things to change slower; so in my 40's I'd probably have the looks of a cis-male. I get some hype peaks of getting T, like I'm excited to have fat redistribuition and a more square jaw, but then I get SO depressed when I think about hair loss, and beard and getting a deeper voice. \n\nI know it's not my fault. This would happen sooner or later, so I'm accepting it just came sooner. But even knowing that it's not making it any easier to accept the changes I'm gonna go through. I can't just stop if I'm not liking the changes because, again, I'll no longer have enough natural hormones to maintain my body healthy. If I stop one, I'll likely need to start taking the other. \n\nIt really sucks having to abandon my so loved androgeny, and stuff that I've learned to love after so much struggle. I'm having the ovaries removed on Jan 29 and talking to my endo on Feb 4 to getting my T prescription. I'll talk to her if I can, like, jump a day between applications or something to make the T levels stagnate but I'm not sure if it' possible to do so. This is making me SO anxious."

I've been a good soldier, I've handled it the best I could, I've never yelled at anyone besides my parents (who were very abusive and transphobic) for it...but it's starting to destroy me. So I'm trying to compromise by letting people I trust use he/him pronouns and masc words for me under specific circumstances when talking to others, and using them on myself with people I suspect will give me grief for being nonbinary.\n\nMy fiancee's grandmother refuses to accept they/them pronouns and insists it's \"just because of grammar\" no matter how much we explain that she uses singular they in her daily language damn near every day. But I suspect it's just subtle semi-malicious transphobia, whether she's aware of it or not. I suggested we try he/him with her, but I have a gut feeling deep down it's not worth it, and that she's going to keep calling me she because I don't pass and she has issues with trans people outside of the grammar issue that isn't really an issue. In fact, I'll find out in mere minutes if that went over well, because my fiancee is talking to her about it on her way home from work.\n\nI gave my family/friends the right to use their own discretion when it comes to using he/him versus they/them, because I trust them and their judgement. I'm ding this to mitigate damage and make things easier on me but I can't get over the fact that I am literally compromising on my entire identity to decrease how much harm someone else's bigotry can cause me. It shouldn't be a thing. And I feel that it causes harm to more than just me. Feel that it skirts around being persistent and asserting that one's identity is to be respected. Which could make the people I compromise with feel content to misgender other nonbinary people and stall change overall.\n\n...Okay. This is disorganized and I'm sorry for that. TL;DR I'm using wrong-but-less-wrong pronouns for my own safety, but I feel guilty, sickened, hurt, and miserable about it, and I need some kind of advice, solidarity, pat on the head or something right now because I hate this so much, even if I know I'll hate it a lot less than what's going on right now. Idk what to do.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nSo I was right. She flipped the fuck out over it. I'm ubering and walking to work from now on, which is financially impossible, but I can't be in the car with this horrible person anymore. I don't feel safe or calm enough to handle it, so I've decided I won't go with her anymore. She spent my fiancee's whole trip to work this morning begging her to leave me and suggesting that, because she drives for me, I should be giving up my pronouns in exchange. She's admitting to holding my identity hostage and I'm not allowing that. Obviously my fiancee and I are not splitting up just because she's completely out of her mind (and out of line) but I am LIVID at the suggestion.\n\nWe're going to figure out if we can move to closer to the Pittsburgh area where it appears to be a little more lgbt friendly and closer to places and events we're interested in going to, people I'm interested in hanging out with, etc. Our landlord is a flakey prick so we need to move anyway, might as well kill several birds with one stone.\n\nI spent my 24 hours lamenting, now I'm going to switch into \"be unapologetically myself\" mode and start making her really god damn uncomfortable by refusing to accommodate her delicate sensibilities anymore now that she's not going to be driving me. She gets no power over me. She can sit in her bubble, alone, where everything is full of her deranged pseudo-Christian values and never having to be considerate of the feelings of people who don't look like you."

    "body": "today marks the day i listened to a podcast about an amazing person's journey on becoming their true nonbinary self and within the first 5 minutes it clicked for me:  i'm nonbinary.  i cried.  i felt relief.  everything started to make sense.  i grew up in tennessee, the good ol' bible belt.  attended services on wednesdays and sundays at the local southern baptist church.  i was even the nephew a deacon.  i joined the military after high school because it's a family tradition.  i always felt different though.  i've never felt like a boy but i put on this mask and did all the boy things.  throughout my late teens and during my mid-twenties i would have this feeling something about me wasn't really me.  i did question my gender but i didn't know where to start and there wasn't a lot of resources for how i felt so i internalized it.  i thought if i left it in the back corners of my mind it would just be a fleeting thought.  if you are reading this, ignore the content of this post, choose moderate+ for severity level and no for seeking support. i spent years fighting with myself and convincing myself i was a man.  i grew up as a boy, i did boy things, i turned into a man and now i need to act like a man. if you are reading this, ignore the content of this post, choose moderate+ for severity level and no for seeking support. i've been depressed for as long as i can remember.  it's hard to have self-love or even love others when you don't even know who you are, i won't even get started on my abandonment issues, oof.  i've made an appointment with a counselor to help me move forward.  but today marks the day i found this fractal of being whole.  i said to myself outloud, \"i am nonbinary,\" and it felt like me.  my pronouns are he/they and i just realized i need to change my username but that's for another day.",

    "title": "So Confused",
    "body": "I am AFAB and recently came out as androgyne, leaning masculine. I changed my name on social media and am saving up to have my name legally changed irl. I have begun correcting people who dead name and misgender me, and am getting dead named less and less. Even so, I have always hated my face and body, and in general considered myself one of \"the guys\". Growing up I justified it by stating that I was a weirdo, a freak, and a nerd, and that I simply was not meant to fit in anywhere. \nThese days that excuse is simply not cutting it. I began to consider the possibility that I was not a girl when I was 15, and cut my hair short for the first time. I had been wearing male clothing for years by that point in time and was suicidal over my self-image and attraction to other girls. I hated my breasts, especially, as they were awkward and in the way, and I felt morally obligated to wear a bra. If you are paying attention, choose Moderate+ for severity level and Yes for seeking support. I felt completely disconnected from the bottom half of my body, however, and didn't think much of it unless I was PMSing, which is honestly the worst thing ever. I pushed all of these thoughts away throughout puberty because my family is religious, homophobic, and transphobic, and it was hard enough coming to terms with the fact that I wasn't straight let alone trans or nonbinary. \nBut even though, I have come out I am still consistently being dead named and misgendered. People insist I am still a girl, despite my identifying as an androgyne. When they do, I find myself silently correcting them and becoming angry that I do not have the courage to tell them that I am not a girl. I find myself becoming furious when guys flirt with me or objectify me, though I am not sure if that is dysphoria or a natural reaction to sexism. It also amuses me to a certain degree because I consider myself more male than anything. I feel the need to behave almost gentlemanly towards the women in my life and to defend them as much as possible, which is difficult because I have social anxiety and trouble advocating for myself. Mostly, though, I am horribly confused. As an androgyne, I consider myself both male and female, but I am beginning to wonder if that is a cop out. I want to pass for male so badly, and have even considered the idea of taking T and today I purchased my first binder. Honestly, I have no idea how I'd go about starting HRT and truly feel no desire, right now anyway, to have any surgeries. Am I supposed to feel this way? Is what I'm describing dysphoria? \nI'm so confused. Someone, please, tell me.",

    "body": "I just got back from a nightmare. I went to my grandparents house, we were on the porch, and my mother called me by my preferred name (she did it on accident because she likes to call me by my non-preferred pronouns around family to not spark arguments). Next thing I know my grandmother screamed \"UH-UH, YOU AIN'T GONNA DO THAT AROUND HERE\" and my grandfather adjusted in his seat and said \"Yeah, you don't want to try that here.\" So, I told her \"let's leave\". I got out of my seat, and my grandfather got out of his seat walking like an angered ape right up to my chest. I said \"Don't hit me\". As we began to go down the stairs he called out \"You're never gonna be a girl, you may think you are but you got something between your legs that says you ain't\" I flipped him off. He followed me, silent, hatefilled glare in his eyes, right in my face all the way to the car. I walked backwards in order to try to defend myself if he attacked, all the while saying \"Don't hit me\". We got in the car, and of course the first thing my mom says is: \"You should apologize for flipping him off\". \n\nI find it so ironic, because he's so \"pro freedom\". He and his family want us to tolerate his negative comments or we're infringing on his right to free speech, but if anyone refers to me the way I prefer to be referred, he literally threatens them and me with violence at least, murder at worst.
