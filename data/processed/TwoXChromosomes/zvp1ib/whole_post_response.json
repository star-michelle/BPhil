Literally haters to lovers type of things. Something really strong. I trust him and I know he\u2019s not going to do anything.\n\nHe has this one ex who he dated for only a month almost a year ago. \n\nHis ex first texted him a while after we got together, they texted for a bit and he told her he has a thing with me (we weren\u2019t official yet) but not in a way she got the hint. Afterwards he blocked her and they didn\u2019t talk for a while, that was more than half a year ago.\n\nTwo months ago she texted him again through her friend\u2019s account (because she\u2019s blocked everywhere) and asked him for closure. He talked with her a bit and told her he\u2019s taken (we were official so he literally wrote her he\u2019s in a happy, healthy relationship) then blocked her again and her friend\u2019s account and asked her not to contact him again. \n\nA few days ago she texted him AGAIN, now being more bold and telling him she\u2019s still in her mind. We once joked about sending her a picture of us the next time she texts, but I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with that because I thought it\u2019d be super insensitive.\n\nHis ex had a complicated life and she suffers from multiple mental illnesses, so I\u2019m being more sensitive about it but still, I get sick to the stomach when it happens. I\u2019m very insecure about myself and I\u2019m trying my best to be the best girlfriend and I can\u2019t help but think she\u2019s so much better than me. I struggle with expressing and talking about how I feel and the fact she just can say it through text makes me feel horrible that I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t be affectionate as she is and she might\u2019ve been a better partner than I am. I literally have these thoughts everytime it happens despite knowing my boyfriend loves me and that he\u2019s not going anywhere. And it makes me feel like a bad gf and a horrible person. \n\nHe told me about everytime she texted him and showed me the conversation before deleting him saying he wants her out of her life and regrets the relationship with her, so it\u2019s not his fault that I\u2019m super insecure and get panic attacks everytime it happens. I literally feel sick to my stomach and can\u2019t eat anything and I feel like it impacts me too much and I don\u2019t know what to do. Any advice?"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly stressful and upsetting, and I want to validate everything you are feeling. It is completely understandable that this situation is causing you anxiety, insecurity, and even physical symptoms like feeling sick to your stomach. You are going through a lot, and it takes courage to reach out for support when you're feeling this overwhelmed.\n\nIt's clear that you are in a loving, committed relationship and that your boyfriend is doing his best to handle this situation responsibly. Let's break down what's happening and focus on steps you can take to protect your peace and strengthen your relationship.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Validating Your Feelings and Thoughts\n\nFirst, let's address the core of your distress:\n\n*   **The Insecurity:** It is a natural human reaction to compare yourself to someone who is actively trying to get your partner's attention, especially when you are already struggling with self-worth. **Please know that these thoughts are distortions driven by anxiety, not facts.** The fact that she can easily express herself or that she had a complicated past relationship with him **does not mean she is better than you.** Your boyfriend is with **you** because of the unique, strong, and complex connection you share.\n*   **The Comparison Trap:** You are comparing your internal struggles (difficulty expressing affection, insecurity) with her external, persistent actions. She is acting out of desperation or fixation; you are acting out of love and commitment, even if you struggle with expression. Your value as a partner is not measured by how easily you can send a bold text message.\n*   **The Impact:** Feeling sick, having panic attacks, and struggling to eat are serious signs that your nervous system is overloaded. This is not you being \"dramatic\" or a \"bad girlfriend\"\u2014it's your body reacting to a perceived threat to your relationship security.\n\n### 2. Analyzing Your Boyfriend's Actions (The Good News)\n\nIt is crucial to recognize how well your boyfriend is handling this, as this should be your anchor of trust:\n\n*   **Transparency:** He tells you immediately and shows you the messages.\n*   **Rejection:** He is consistently telling her he is taken, happy, and healthy in his relationship with you.\n*   **Boundaries:** He is blocking her and her friends repeatedly and explicitly asking her not to contact him.\n*   **Regret:** He has expressed regret over the past relationship and wants her out of his life.\n\n**His actions prove that he is committed to you and is actively prioritizing your relationship and your feelings.** This is not his fault, and you are right to trust him.\n\n### 3. Immediate Action Plan: Setting Hard Boundaries\n\nSince the ex is escalating and ignoring boundaries, a shift in strategy is needed to stop engaging entirely.\n\n#### A. The Final, Hard Boundary\n\nYour boyfriend needs to send one final, unequivocal message (if he hasn't already) and then enforce a **zero-tolerance policy.**\n\n**If he feels he needs to send one last message (and only if he hasn't already done so clearly since the last text):**\n\n> \"Do not text me again. I am in a committed, happy relationship and I will not respond to any future messages from you or anyone on your behalf. This is harassment. I wish you well, but do not contact me.\"\n\n**Then, the most important part:**\n\n#### B. The Zero-Tolerance Policy (The \"Ignore and Block\" Rule)\n\nFrom now on, the strategy must be:\n\n1.  **Do not respond to the ex or any of her friends, ever, regardless of the content.** No closure, no explanations, no jokes, no acknowledgment.\n2.  **Immediately block the number/account.**\n3.  **Do not show you the messages immediately.** While transparency is good, the act of reading the message is what triggers your panic and insecurity.\n\nThis is critical. **The ex is seeking attention and reaction.** By responding, even to reject her, she gets the attention she craves. By going completely silent, she loses her power to provoke.\n\n### 4. Focusing on Your Relationship and Well-being\n\nSince your boyfriend has handled his part, the focus now must shift to how you and your boyfriend handle the emotional fallout together.\n\n#### A. Communicating Your Needs (Even When It's Hard)\n\nYou mentioned you struggle with expressing your feelings, but this situation demands that you find a way to communicate your distress. You don't have to be perfectly articulate\u2014just honest.\n\n**Try using \"I\" statements:**\n\n*   \"When she texts you, **I feel** sick to my stomach and **I worry** that I'm not good enough.\"\n*   \"**I need** your reassurance right now, even though I know you love me.\"\n*   \"**I need** us to agree that the next time she texts, we don't even read the message\u2014we just block it immediately, so I don't get triggered.\"\n\nYour boyfriend loves you and wants to help. Give him the tools to do so by telling him exactly what you need.\n\n#### B. Creating a \"Reassurance Ritual\"\n\nSince you know these texts trigger panic, establish a routine with your boyfriend for when they happen (even if you agree to block them unread).\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the Anxiety:** He can simply say, \"I see that you're stressed. This is hard, but we are a team.\"\n2.  **Reaffirm Commitment:** He should immediately pivot to reaffirming your relationship. This could be a hug, a verbal reminder (\"I love you, and I am committed only to you\"), or doing an activity that refocuses you both on the present.\n3.  **Focus on the Present:** The moment a text comes in, pivot the conversation to something you are excited about doing together, or a recent happy memory. Force your brains out of the past and into your future.\n\n#### C. Addressing Your Insecurity (Self-Care)\n\nYou are dealing with anxiety and insecurity that existed before this situation, but the ex is acting as a painful trigger.\n\n*   **Challenge the Comparison:** The next time you think, \"She's better than me,\" immediately counter it with facts: \"My boyfriend chose me. We have a strong, real connection. Her behavior is desperate; my relationship is stable.\"\n*   **Focus on Your Strengths:** Make a list of five things you love about yourself and five things you know your boyfriend loves about you (your humor, your intelligence, your kindness, your loyalty, etc.). When the anxiety hits, read the list.\n*   **Seek External Support:** Since this is causing panic attacks and impacting your health (eating issues), **I strongly encourage you to speak with a therapist or counselor.** They can give you specific coping mechanisms for anxiety (like grounding techniques) and help you build self-worth that isn't dependent on external circumstances.\n\nYou are not a bad girlfriend or a horrible person. You are a young woman in a tough situation who is trying to protect her heart. By setting clear boundaries with the ex and communicating openly with your boyfriend, you can minimize the impact this person has on your life."
