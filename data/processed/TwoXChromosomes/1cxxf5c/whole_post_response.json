      "content": "I (29M) Got My Heart Broken By the First Girl I ever Opened Up to\n\nI wanted to make this post because I am in a lot of pain after things ended with a girl I had been seeing for a few months\n\nFor context, I dated a lot in college but was emotionally unavailable during that time due to early childhood trauma and being on SSRIs and ADHD medication my whole life. I never really learned to feel feelings until I went off meds after college. I also got Lyme disease after college and didn\u2019t date from 24-29 because of it. So I had never truly opened my heart to someone until I got off meds, treated my Lyme, and did a ton of work in therapy.\n\nFast forward to March 24\u2019 - I met this beautiful girl through a mutual friend and we went on a few dates and hit it off pretty well. I invited her over for dinner on the second date and cooked her a really lovely meal which she enjoyed! We had been flirting over text prior and it seemed like we were both of the mind that physical intimacy was on the table that night, but I didn\u2019t plan to have sex because I wanted to take it slower. We made it to the bedroom and she informed me that she had an STD, to which I didn\u2019t really know how to respond. We were both drunk at that point and I got excited, ignored my original intentions, and tried to have sex anyway without really asking her about her condition, which was not smart I realize. I struggle with ED and even though I didn\u2019t intend to have sex with her, I was able to get it up so I figured \u201coh shit I have to act on this moment, but as I was about to engage, I couldn\u2019t and I mentioned I got \u201cthrown off\u201d by her comment and we decided to just cuddle instead. I followed up with her the next day and tried to be as much of a gentleman as I could, explaining that it takes a while for me to be vulnerable and I wanted to take it slower with her, but I had a lapse in judgement that night. \n\nWe ended up going on a few more dates and finally engaging in physical intimacy. She also told me at one point after the STD mixup that she liked being single.\n\nAfter our fourth date, I started being more intentional with her - being more forward about seeing her, and dropping in nice comments into what was mostly sexual banter between us. She didn\u2019t respond well to that, even noting that one of my nice comments \u201cwas the worst thing I\u2019ve ever said\u201d.\n\nCome the fifth date, she is super distant and even says to me \u201cI\u2019m going to ghost you after this\u201d, and made it clear that she didn\u2019t want me to meet her friends either. After that date I followed up with her to explain how I was feeling, and we decided to move on.\n\nI can\u2019t help but feel like I was \u201cfuck-zoned\u201d and thrown away by this girl who I really fell for, and in the end she was super unkind to me. Our mutual friend told me from the start that he was worried about how she might treat me, but I ignored him because I was smitten with her.\n\nThis was two weeks ago and I am still in a ton of pain. I wanted to post this here to try and get a feminine perspective on the situation. Thank you!"

      "content": "That sounds incredibly painful and difficult to process. Thank you for sharing such a raw and honest account of what you went through. It takes a lot of courage to open up, especially when you've done so much work to be emotionally available for the first time in your life.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are in a ton of pain right now. You didn't just lose a casual connection; you lost the first person you truly allowed yourself to be vulnerable with after years of healing and preparation. That sting is deep, and you absolutely deserve to feel and process that grief.\n\nBefore I offer a perspective, I want to acknowledge a few things you mentioned that are really significant:\n\n1.  **This was a massive emotional milestone for you.** Opening up after early childhood trauma, years on medication, and a long period of focusing on your health (Lyme disease) is huge. You successfully crossed a barrier you had struggled with for years. That is a victory, even if the outcome of this relationship wasn't what you hoped for.\n2.  **You showed immense self-awareness.** You recognized the lapse in judgment on the second date, you followed up respectfully, and you were intentional about slowing things down and communicating your needs. These are signs of emotional maturity and healthy dating behavior.\n\nIt sounds like you are looking for a \"feminine perspective\" on why things unfolded this way, particularly why she became distant and unkind when you started expressing deeper feelings.\n\nHere is a perspective on what might have been happening, based on the timeline and her actions:\n\n***\n\n### Analyzing the Dynamics\n\nIt seems like you and this girl had fundamentally different expectations or goals for the connection, and the moment your goals shifted, the dynamic shattered.\n\n#### 1. Her Clarity vs. Your Hope\n\nYou mentioned two key pieces of information she gave you early on:\n\n*   **She told you she liked being single.** This is often a huge flag that someone is not looking for commitment, emotional depth, or a serious relationship, regardless of how enjoyable the physical connection is.\n*   **She became distant and even cruel when you started being intentional.** When you started dropping \"nice comments\" and being more forward about seeing her, you were signaling a shift from a casual, fun, mostly sexual dynamic toward something more serious and emotional.\n\n**The \"Feminine Perspective\" on her actions:**\n\nFor some women (and men) who prefer casual connections, **emotional vulnerability is a boundary they actively avoid.** When you introduced deeper feelings and intentionality, you changed the nature of the relationship from something low-stakes and fun (which she was comfortable with, especially since she \"likes being single\") to something high-stakes and potentially demanding (which she explicitly did not want).\n\nHer reaction\u2014saying your nice comment \"was the worst thing I\u2019ve ever said\" and stating she was going to \"ghost you\"\u2014was a harsh, defensive attempt to immediately push you back into the \"casual/sexual\" box, or push you away entirely, because she felt the relationship was moving in a direction she didn't want it to go.\n\n#### 2. The \"Fuck-Zoned\" Feeling\n\nIt sounds very much like you were in a dynamic where she was only interested in the physical and casual aspect of the relationship, and yes, when you tried to elevate it, you were essentially \"rejected\" from moving into the relationship zone.\n\nIt\u2019s important to remember that being \"fuck-zoned\" isn't a reflection of your worth; it's a reflection of her specific, limited interest in you at that time. She enjoyed the physical connection, the banter, and the fun, but not the emotional responsibility or commitment that came with your expressed feelings.\n\n#### 3. The Unkindness\n\nHer unkindness, while painful, is often a defense mechanism used by people who are emotionally unavailable or afraid of hurting someone. When she realized you were developing feelings, she used harsh words and distance to create a quick, clean break, hoping the cruelty would make you leave faster.\n\nYour friend's concern about how she might treat you suggests this is a pattern of behavior for her. She likely handles transitions and breakups poorly, especially when someone starts to care for her more than she cares for them.\n\n***\n\n### What You Should Focus On Now\n\nWhile the pain is intense, please try to reframe this experience:\n\n1.  **Your Success:** You did it. You opened your heart. You were vulnerable. You communicated your feelings respectfully. You proved to yourself that you are capable of forming deep connections and putting yourself out there. This pain is proof that you are **feeling your feelings**\u2014a huge step forward from your past.\n2.  **The Mismatch:** This outcome was a result of a fundamental mismatch in what you both wanted. You were looking for a relationship; she was looking for a casual companion. You found this out relatively quickly, and while the delivery was awful, you saved yourself months or years of trying to change someone who was already clear about their boundaries (\"I like being single\").\n3.  **Self-Compassion:** Be incredibly kind to yourself right now. Grieve the future you imagined with her, and grieve the fact that your first successful attempt at deep vulnerability ended in disappointment. That pain is real and valid. Lean on your support systems (like your mutual friend or your therapist).\n\nYou are 29, and you have successfully completed the hardest part: the emotional heavy lifting to prepare for a healthy relationship. This girl was simply the wrong recipient for the amazing, intentional effort you put in.\n\n**What clarification might help you right now?**\n\nAre you feeling more confused about her motives, or are you struggling more with the pain of the rejection itself? Knowing what is most difficult for you right now might help focus the support."
