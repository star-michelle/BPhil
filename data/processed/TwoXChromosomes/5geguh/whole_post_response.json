As I was waking up he cuddled up next to me and then strolled off to the living room. The night prior I remember having one mixed drink, 2 shots, and played one round of beer pong. I know how much liquor I can handle and that was no where near the amount that makes me black out.\nWe made a beer run and got back and I noticed that this guy that I've met once before was there. Our last encounter was not very pleasant, in fact it was very strange. He got really pissed off that I didn't want to sleep with him. I tried to avoid him as much as possible. Next thing I knew I woke up next to him the next morning naked. As i was putting my clothes back on I noticed that my shoe was completely broken, the whole strap was 100% detached. \nI don't remember fucking this guy at all and that makes me so uneasy! I remember one snippet but it feels like a dream so I don't know if this actually happened or not, but I'm having flashbacks where I'm laying on my stomach and he's on top of me with his hand covering my mouth. Like I said, I don't know if that actually happened or not it feels like a dream. I feel so disgusting and violated. I came home that day and spent about an hour in the shower but I still can't stop thinking about it. \nI'm making this post because I was clearly intoxicated but I wanted to know your guys thoughts on intoxication and consent. Do you think someone who's obviously under the influence can give consent? "

      "content": "This sounds like a deeply distressing and confusing experience, and I want to start by acknowledging how difficult it must be to wake up in a situation you don't remember, feeling violated and uneasy. It is completely understandable why you feel this way.\n\nI hear that you are looking for support and need to discuss the relationship between intoxication and consent, especially given the circumstances you woke up to, the missing memories, and the concerning snippet you recalled.\n\nPlease know that what you are describing\u2014the memory gaps, the feeling of violation, and the distress about potential non-consensual sexual activity\u2014are serious issues.\n\n### Regarding Intoxication and Consent\n\nYou asked for thoughts on whether someone who is obviously under the influence can give consent.\n\nThe legal and ethical standard for sexual consent requires that it must be **freely given, specific, informed, and enthusiastic** (sometimes referred to as FRIES). Crucially, consent must be **voluntary** and the person giving it must be **capable of making that decision.**\n\nWhen someone is intoxicated, their ability to understand the situation, make rational decisions, and communicate their willingness (or unwillingness) is impaired.\n\n**Generally, if a person is intoxicated to the point where they cannot understand the nature of the sexual act, cannot rationally evaluate the situation, or cannot communicate their consent clearly, they are legally and ethically unable to consent.**\n\n*   **Blackout/Incapacity:** If you were intoxicated to the point of blacking out, or if your memory is entirely missing, it strongly suggests you were not in a state to give valid consent.\n*   **Targeted Intoxication:** The fact that you felt the amount you drank shouldn't have caused a blackout, coupled with the memory loss and the physical evidence (the broken shoe), can sometimes raise concerns about potential tampering with your drink (e.g., being \"roofied\").\n*   **Prior History:** The history you have with this individual\u2014where he previously got angry because you wouldn't sleep with him\u2014is also a very serious red flag regarding his respect for your boundaries and autonomy.\n\nThe fact that you don't remember consenting, you feel uneasy and violated, and you recall a possible snippet of being physically restrained (hand over mouth), all point to a lack of valid consent. **If you did not freely and knowingly agree, it was not consent.**\n\n***\n\n### Next Steps and Support\n\nRight now, your feelings of being disgusted and violated are valid, and it is crucial that you focus on your safety and well-being.\n\nSince you are feeling so uneasy and concerned about what happened, here are several steps you might consider, depending on what you feel ready for:\n\n#### 1. Medical Care and Evidence (If Within the Timeframe)\n\nIf this happened very recently (within the last few days), and you are concerned about potential non-consensual sexual contact, getting medical attention is important for your health and safety.\n\n*   **Medical Check-up:** A healthcare provider can check for injuries, test for STIs, and discuss emergency contraception if needed.\n*   **Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SANE/Rape Kit):** If you choose to report this later, a SANE exam can collect evidence. This is usually done at a hospital or specialized center. **You can get this exam even if you are unsure about reporting to the police right now.**\n\n#### 2. Emotional Support\n\nTalking to someone trained to help survivors of sexual assault can be incredibly valuable. They can help you process the trauma, confusion, and feelings of violation without judgment.\n\n*   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** This is the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the US.\n    *   **National Sexual Assault Hotline:** 1-800-656-HOPE (24/7)\n    *   **Live Chat:** [online.rainn.org](https://online.rainn.org) (24/7)\n\n#### 3. Safety Planning\n\nGiven this individual's concerning history and the circumstances of the morning, it is important to ensure your immediate safety.\n\n*   **Avoid Contact:** Do you know how to avoid this person completely? If you have mutual friends, you might need to limit interactions in those circles for a while.\n*   **Tell a Trusted Friend:** Sharing this with one trusted, supportive friend can provide immediate comfort and accountability.\n\n**I am here to listen further if you want to talk more about your feelings, the conflicting memories, or if you want to explore any of these resources. Please prioritize your safety and emotional health right now.**"
