I'm in my 20s and I want/need a hysterectomy.\n\nI've asked this here before, but was met with a lot of vitriol, but I'm hopeful I can explain my situation better and be met with more advice than down votes. If there's a better sub to post this in, please redirect me and I'll cross post. When I was 12 years old I got my first period. I spent three days lying on the bathroom floor, alternating between throwing up and sitting on the toilet, unable to think clearly I was in so much pain. By the fourth day, I took 4 ibuprofen in a row and was able to get up. I started going through a rather interesting puberty when I was around 13. My voice broke and deepened. I began growing a beard and hair on my chest and stomach. My acne went bonkers. My boobs grew in, oddly. They are not full, and even if they stayed this small, they are stuck at a rather immature, half grown in phase. From age 12 to age 17, I thought everyone had to leave school when they got their period. I thought everyone was overdosing on pain killers as their cramps started at their backs and went down to their feet. I thought everyone had killer hot flashes. But then I went to college and found out none of that was the norm. First gynecologist visit. I talk about my body hair, my facial hair, my random periods (one month, skip two months, then get it one week then a week later get it again), the pain I had during sex, how scary it was to poop while on my period because it hurt so bad, etc. She decided to take an ultrasound of my ovaries. My ovaries are littered with cysts. But it's not the worst she had seen. And it didn't explain all of my symptoms. Most, but there were a few lingering. So they do another ultrasound, looking not at my ovaries but around my uterus and surrounding organs. What they find isn't pretty. It's endometriosis. I was having such horrible pains because it's attached itself to everything. It wanted to be friends with all the organs I guess -.- I get put on birth control to help control it. We try a lot of different medications. My ovaries are making testosterone, my utuerus is acting clingy to all my organs and the symptoms go away while I'm on it,the second I miss a pill/meds or try to stop it, I'm back on the floor 12 years old, wondering why it hurts this bad. I'm sorry if I'm ranting. I'm trying to give the full picture. I desperately wanted to be a mom. I knew even when I was young, I wanted to become a mommy and have kids. Thats' what I put up with it. Those periods were worth it because one day they'd result in children and I'd be happy. I kept telling myself, as I slept with ice packs and I popped pills, one day I'd look back and be grateful. Then my gynecologist tells me, with PCOS, endometriosis and type 1 diabetes of my entire life, I should not have kids. That I should consider a hysterectomy. I might be infertile. Even when off birth control, sometimes I've had unprotected sex and I have never gotten preggers. I've used plan B before, but not every time, and even statistically, on birth control you'd think it'd at least happen once in 7 years of being sexually active and not 100% sexually protective. But now, even if I did get pregnant, I likely wouldn't survive the pregnancy. My diabetes is a bitch to control, my hormones even controlled make it go wild. I'd have to get an abortion, because I don't think or trust my body to survive that. This utuerus isn't even safe for me to have, why would it be safe for a child? It kills me saying this. Writing it all out and admitting that I spent years of my life convinced all the pain was worth it. Now every period is a new agony. It's an agony knowing it's not worth it. Years of pain, hot flashes, cramps that rival contractions, and now three different doctors have all recommended hysterectomies to me. I've been friends with older women, childfree, who had endometriosis, not even diabetes and PCOS just endometriosis and they say it was the best decision they ever made. It tears me up, but I know it's what would improve my life. Going through a period is hell. If I miss a single pill, bam bleeding. Bam cramps. Hot flash! cramps, irritable, anger, frustration. The hysterectomy doesn't tear me up, but facing the reality that I will never get pregnant on my terms or be able to be healthy with it is frustrating. I reacted to this by becoming as masculine as possible. It's only now I've come to terms that I may lose the possibility of pregnancy that I've accepted being feminine. Three doctors. I need to find a new ob/gyn who will do this to me, and I just don't know what to do. It's hard enough to find a doctor who will do this to a 40 year old. Why should it be like this? Why should I be reminded every month that my body can't do what I always wanted? Who do I talk to? How do I get them to listen? Can I ask them to let me keep my ovaries? The last doctor said to take out my uterus but to leave my ovaries, as they aren't too bad now (the cysts are less than there was before). I would have to keep taking hormones but I'd no longer bleed. I'd no longer have to fear the off-chance they're wrong and I get pregnant and then die. I don't know. I'm tired. I want to not be in pain for most of the month. I want to live my life. I want..."

      "content": "This is a tremendously difficult and complex situation, and I am so sorry that you have had to carry this burden of pain, uncertainty, and grief for so long.\n\nThank you for sharing your story so clearly. Please know that what you are describing\u2014the level of pain, the complications, and the multiple medical recommendations for a hysterectomy\u2014is a powerful indication that this is a necessary and life-changing step for your health and safety.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are exhausted and frustrated. Dealing with chronic pain while fighting medical gatekeeping is draining. Your feelings about the loss of the dream of biological motherhood are valid, deep, and deserve to be acknowledged.\n\nLet\u2019s break down your situation and focus on the practical steps for moving forward, especially regarding finding the right surgical support.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Validating Your Medical Necessity\n\nThe combination of your conditions creates a serious medical imperative for intervention:\n\n1.  **Widespread Endometriosis:** Your description of the endo attaching to multiple organs explains the severity of your pain, especially during bowel movements and sex. A hysterectomy (combined with excision of the endo lesions) is often the most effective way to eliminate this source of agony and improve long-term quality of life.\n2.  **PCOS:** While PCOS symptoms (like testosterone production and irregular cycles) won't be fully cured by a hysterectomy, removing the uterus eliminates the painful, unpredictable bleeding and cramping that results from the hormonal chaos.\n3.  **Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and Pregnancy Risk:** This is the critical safety factor. Uncontrolled hormones during pregnancy can make T1D management nearly impossible, leading to life-threatening complications for both you and the potential fetus. Your doctors are absolutely correct in prioritizing your survival.\n\nYou have three medical professionals who have independently recommended this procedure. This is not a choice you are making lightly; it is a medically indicated necessity for your ongoing health and well-being.\n\n## 2. Addressing Your Questions about the Hysterectomy\n\n### Can I ask them to let me keep my ovaries?\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** This is called an **Ovary-Sparing Hysterectomy**.\n\n*   **The Goal:** The primary reason for keeping the ovaries (especially in women under 50) is to avoid immediate surgical menopause. If your ovaries are left in place, they will continue producing hormones (estrogen and testosterone) naturally, which is crucial for bone health, heart health, and overall well-being.\n*   **Your Situation:** Since you have PCOS, your ovaries are already producing hormones (including excess testosterone), but removing the uterus eliminates the target organ for the painful bleeding. Your last doctor\u2019s recommendation to keep them is sound, especially since your cysts are currently controlled.\n*   **The Caveat (Endometriosis):** Endometriosis is fueled by estrogen. If you keep your ovaries, there is a small risk that existing or missed endometriosis lesions could continue to grow, causing pain again later. However, many surgeons prefer to try the ovary-sparing route first, as the benefits of natural hormones often outweigh this risk, particularly for younger patients.\n\n**Action Step:** Be firm that you want an ovary-sparing hysterectomy unless the surgeon finds a compelling reason (like severe, widespread adherence or damage to the ovaries themselves) to remove them during the procedure.\n\n## 3. How to Find a Doctor Who Will Listen (Overcoming Gatekeeping)\n\nThe biggest hurdle you face is age-related gatekeeping, even with strong medical history. General OB/GYNs are often hesitant to perform hysterectomies on patients in their 20s.\n\nYou need to shift your search away from general practitioners and toward specialists who handle complex chronic disease.\n\n### A. Focus on the Right Specialty\n\nDo not just look for an OB/GYN. Look specifically for:\n\n1.  **Endometriosis Excision Specialists:** These surgeons are highly skilled at identifying and removing deep, widespread endometriosis lesions (which is essential if you get the procedure). They are accustomed to dealing with debilitating pain and complex surgeries involving multiple organs. They are far less likely to prioritize a non-functional uterus over a patient\u2019s quality of life.\n2.  **Minimally Invasive Gynecological Surgeons (MIGS):** These specialists often deal with the most difficult cases and are trained in advanced techniques like robotic or laparoscopic hysterectomy, which can be better for complex adhesions.\n3.  **Surgeons at University or Teaching Hospitals:** These institutions often handle the most severe and unusual cases and may be more open to performing necessary surgery on a younger patient based on medical indication.\n\n### B. Prepare Your \"Case\"\n\nWhen you go into a consultation, you need to present a firm, well-documented case:\n\n*   **Bring the Evidence:** Gather all medical records, ultrasound reports (showing the widespread endo), and notes from the three doctors who recommended the hysterectomy.\n*   **State the Risk:** Clearly articulate that this is not just about pain management; it is a life-saving measure due to the **unacceptable risk of pregnancy combined with Type 1 Diabetes.** Frame the surgery as a necessary sterilization due to life-threatening medical instability.\n*   **Use Specific Language:** Use terms like \"medically indicated,\" \"quality of life,\" and \"failure of conservative management\" (referencing the many birth control pills you have tried).\n*   **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If a doctor immediately dismisses you or says, \"You're too young,\" without reviewing your files, thank them politely and move on. You are looking for a surgeon, not a counselor.\n\n## 4. Emotional Support and Resources\n\nIt is heartbreaking to acknowledge the loss of the future you had planned. The physical relief you will gain from the surgery does not erase the grief you feel about infertility.\n\n### A. Acknowledge the Grief\n\nIt is completely normal to mourn the loss of biological motherhood, even when the decision to prevent it is necessary for survival. You are mourning a dream, and that requires time and space.\n\n### B. Finding Community Support\n\nYou asked where to post this. There are several communities that focus on these intersecting issues:\n\n1.  **r/endo and r/PCOS:** These communities are filled with people who have faced similar diagnostic delays and surgical decisions. They often share lists of \"Endo Specialists\" or \"Excision Surgeons\" in various regions.\n2.  **r/childfree (or similar groups focused on sterilization):** While your situation is medically necessary, these communities often maintain lists of doctors who are known to be non-judgmental and willing to perform sterilization/hysterectomies on younger patients, which can be a valuable resource for finding a supportive surgeon.\n3.  **Chronic Illness Communities:** Sometimes connecting with others who manage complex, intersecting chronic illnesses (like T1D and hormonal issues) can provide validation.\n\nYou are not alone in this fight. The pain you have endured is real, and the future you are fighting for\u2014one free from debilitating pain and medical risk\u2014is absolutely achievable. Keep advocating for yourself. You deserve to live your life without constant agony."
