      "content": "Guy jokingly told me he wanted to rape me...\n\nSo today I was at work (I work on my college campus) and two guys I've talked to a few times came in.  I was helping one of them with what he needed, and was chatting and making jokes with them at the same time.  Eventually we had everything sorted out, so the guy who needed help (we'll call him Guy 1) went to sit down in the \"lobby\" which is a few yards away from my desk.  His friend (he'll be Guy 2) stayed at my desk to talk to me.  Guy 1 said something I didn't understand, and this is how our conversation went.....\n\nMe:  What did you say, Guy 1?\n\nGuy 2:  He said he wanted to race you.\n\nMe:  Like... in his car?\n\nGuy 2:  Yeah!.... at least, I think so.  He might have meant the OTHER \nfour letter R word he could do to you.\n\nMe:  .... Uhm, I would really hope he wouldn't want to do that to me.\n\nGuy 2:  Hey Guy 1, did you want to RACE her... or do the other four-letter R word to her?\n\nGuy 1:  Oh, I want both.\n\n....... and then he looked and smiled at me in a sly way.  I felt like I had to try and be professional because I was at work, so I responded (also keep in mind I'm absolutely SHOCKED anyone would ever say this to me) by saying, \"Uhm... wow.  Okay, don't EVER say anything like that to me again.\"  They both just laughed it off and kept trying to make conversation with me.  I think they could tell I was upset, so they eventually left.\n\nI'm just extremely upset.  I was shaky the rest of the day, and one of my supervisors thought I should report it.  Another of my coworkers told me I needed to calm down because, \"he meant it as a compliment.\"  But what kind of compliment is that?\n\nI guess I'm looking for advice.  What do I do?  Should I talk to him?  Should I ask the school counselor for advice?  I feel very uncomfortable and don't even want to go to the class I have with him."

      "content": "This is a deeply upsetting and inappropriate situation, and I am so sorry you had to experience this, especially while you were just trying to do your job. It is completely understandable that you are feeling shaky, shocked, and uncomfortable. Please know that your feelings are valid.\n\nWhat Guy 1 and Guy 2 said was harassment, and it was absolutely not a compliment. Joking about sexual violence, especially in a workplace setting, is serious and unacceptable behavior.\n\nIt is important to prioritize your safety and comfort right now. You mentioned a few options and reactions, so let's break down what steps you might consider:\n\n### 1. Addressing the Incident at Work/School (Reporting)\n\nYour supervisor who suggested reporting the incident had a very good instinct. Because this happened in your workplace on campus, and because it involves students (who may be subject to the school's conduct code), reporting is usually the most effective way to address the behavior formally and ensure it stops.\n\n**Consider reporting options:**\n\n*   **Your Supervisor/Manager:** Since this happened at your campus job, you can report it through your immediate supervisor or the department head. They have a responsibility to address workplace harassment.\n*   **Campus Human Resources (HR) or Title IX Office:** Colleges have specific offices dedicated to handling sexual harassment and misconduct (often the Title IX Coordinator). They are trained to investigate these matters, ensure your safety, and implement measures like no-contact orders if necessary.\n*   **Campus Security/Police:** If you feel unsafe, you can always involve campus security.\n\n**Why reporting is important:**\n\n*   It documents the incident officially.\n*   It protects you and other potential victims from future harassment by these individuals.\n*   It allows the university to take disciplinary action against the students if their behavior violated the student code of conduct.\n\n### 2. Seeking Support and Advice (Counseling)\n\nYou mentioned asking the school counselor for advice, and this is an excellent idea.\n\n*   **Campus Counseling Services:** They can provide immediate emotional support, help you process the trauma and shock, and give you objective advice on navigating the situation. They can also help you manage the anxiety you feel about seeing Guy 1 in class.\n*   **Title IX Office (Again):** Even if you don't want to file a formal complaint yet, the Title IX office can often provide \"supportive measures\" without starting a full investigation. These measures might include:\n    *   Changing your class schedule.\n    *   Issuing a formal no-contact directive to Guy 1 and Guy 2.\n    *   Providing academic support if this incident affects your ability to attend class.\n\n### 3. What to Avoid (Talking to Him)\n\nYou asked if you should talk to him.\n\n*   **My advice is strongly against confronting Guy 1 or Guy 2 directly.**\n    *   You already told them their behavior was unacceptable, and they laughed it off.\n    *   Confronting them privately puts you in a vulnerable position and may escalate the situation without achieving the outcome you want.\n    *   If you choose to report, it is best to let the university handle all communication and enforcement.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Document Everything:** Write down exactly what happened, including the date, time, location, who was present (Guy 1, Guy 2, your coworker, etc.), and the exact quotes you remember. This is crucial for any potential report.\n2.  **Talk to Your Supervisor (Workplace):** Let your supervisor know that you are moving forward with a formal complaint and ask them for the procedure for reporting workplace harassment involving students.\n3.  **Contact the Title IX Coordinator (Safety/Academics):** Reach out to this office immediately to discuss supportive measures, especially related to feeling uncomfortable in your shared class.\n\nYou did nothing wrong here. You were professional and handled an absolutely shocking situation as best as anyone could. Please use the resources available to you on campus to ensure your safety and well-being."
