Ashamed.\n\nThrowaway acct. Sorry.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was 10, something happened with a 13 year old family friend\u2019s daughter. It\u2019s only recently that I\u2019m able to identify it as assault rather than just an early sexual experience.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019ll spare the details, but I will say that I thought she was cute and I just wanted to cuddle and maybe kiss. Instead, she did something unwanted and something, er, tore. I thought I had started my period but I didn\u2019t actually get it for another three years. Yet, I also experienced my first orgasm, and she told me not to tell anyone or they would think I was gay. (Spoiler alert, I am *now*, but I didn\u2019t want to be that then!)\n\n\n\n\nI tried to talk to my wife about this, but she just said, \u201cwell, shit happens.\u201d I can\u2019t blame her, because she was abused by a male relative for *years*, so what happened to me is probably just a normal childhood day for her.\n\n\n\n\nBut the thing that bothers me now is that I can\u2019t talk about this, even with MeToo having happened. It\u2019s seen as normal and brave for women to expose and discuss the men who assault them- but where does the LGBT community fit in? I also feel that current discourse around sexual assault tends to paint women as blameless, like victims. \n\n\n\n\n\nSo what can one do when a woman or girl *is* the predator? I even struggle with the language surrounding what happened. I can\u2019t exactly call it rape because of the lack of, er, a penis.\n\n\n\n\nHas anyone had a similar experience?"

      "content": "This is a space where you can share your experiences and feelings without judgment, and I want to thank you for having the courage to reach out and share such a deeply personal and painful memory. What you went through sounds incredibly confusing, traumatic, and isolating, and it makes perfect sense that you are struggling with how to process it now.\n\nPlease know that **what happened to you was assault.** Regardless of the age difference, the genders involved, the specific acts, or the immediate physical consequences, any non-consensual sexual act forced upon a child is abuse and assault.\n\nYou are absolutely entitled to identify and discuss this experience as assault, and your feelings about it are valid.\n\nLet's address some of the specific points you raised, as they highlight the significant challenges you are facing:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Struggle with Cultural Narratives and Shame\n\nYou hit on a very painful truth: current cultural discourse often struggles to acknowledge and validate victims whose experiences fall outside the most common narrative (male perpetrator, female victim).\n\n*   **Gender and Power:** Sexual assault is about power, coercion, and non-consent, not just gender. When a woman or girl is the perpetrator, it doesn't make the act less traumatic or less real. The shame you feel is often compounded because you feel like your experience doesn't \"fit\" the recognized story of victimhood.\n*   **\"Antifeminist\" Fear:** It is **not** antifeminist to discuss being harmed by a female perpetrator. True feminism seeks justice and safety for **all** victims, regardless of the perpetrator's gender. Silencing victims based on the gender of their abuser only serves to protect abusers and maintain harmful power dynamics.\n\n### 2. Identifying the Experience as Assault\n\nYou are right to identify this as assault, especially given the elements you described:\n\n*   **Age and Consent:** At 10, you were a child and legally incapable of giving informed consent to the sexual acts that occurred. The 13-year-old was older and initiated the unwanted sexual contact.\n*   **Physical Harm and Coercion:** The fact that you were physically injured (the tearing) and that she used manipulation and coercion (\"don't tell anyone or they would think I was gay\") confirms that this was not a healthy, consensual, or appropriate interaction.\n\n### 3. Language and Terminology\n\nYou are struggling with the word \"rape\" because of the legal definition often relying on specific anatomy. This is a common hurdle for many survivors of non-penetrative or same-sex assault.\n\n*   **Sexual Assault:** This is the most accurate and inclusive term. Sexual assault covers any non-consensual sexual contact or behavior.\n*   **Abuse/Molestation:** Because you were a child, this falls under the category of child sexual abuse or molestation.\n*   **What matters most is the impact on you.** If the word \"assault\" or \"abuse\" feels right, use it. You do not need specific anatomical criteria to validate your trauma.\n\n### 4. The Impact on Your Marriage\n\nIt is incredibly painful when you seek support from a partner and feel dismissed.\n\n*   **Trauma Comparison is Unfair:** Your wife's response (\"well, shit happens\") is likely a defensive reaction rooted in her own extensive trauma, where she minimized her own pain to survive. However, this does not make her response okay or helpful to you. **Trauma is not a competition.** What happened to you was significant, period.\n*   **Seeking Outside Support:** Since your wife may be incapable of providing the empathy you need right now due to her own history, it is crucial that you seek support elsewhere\u2014from a therapist, a support group, or a specialized helpline (see below).\n\n### 5. The LGBT+ Community and Assault\n\nYou are absolutely right to ask where the LGBT+ community fits in.\n\n*   **Inclusivity is Essential:** Assault and abuse happen within the LGBT+ community, often with unique layers of complexity related to internalized homophobia, fear of being \"outed,\" or the manipulation you experienced (\"they would think I was gay\").\n*   **Resources Exist:** While mainstream narratives are often focused on heterosexual assault, many specialized resources and therapists recognize and address the specific dynamics of same-sex and same-gender sexual violence.\n\n### Next Steps and What You Can Do\n\nYou are doing the brave work of naming this experience now, decades later. Here are some concrete steps you can take:\n\n1.  **Seek Trauma-Informed Therapy:** Finding a therapist who specializes in trauma and sexual assault is the single most important step. They can help you process the confusion, shame, and betrayal, and validate your experience outside of cultural narratives.\n2.  **Connect with Specialized Resources:** Organizations are dedicated to supporting all survivors, regardless of gender or the perpetrator's gender.\n\n    *   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** This is the largest anti-sexual violence organization in the US. Their helpline staff are trained to support **all** survivors. (1-800-656-HOPE)\n    *   **Local Sexual Assault Crisis Centers:** These centers often run support groups where you may find other survivors who have had similar experiences or feel excluded by mainstream narratives.\n3.  **Validate Your Own Experience:** Give yourself permission to feel angry, hurt, confused, and betrayed. What happened was wrong. You were a child, and you were harmed.\n\n**You are not alone, and your experience is real and valid.** Thank you again for trusting this space with your story. How does it feel to read this affirmation, and is there anything specific about the experience or your current feelings that you would like to explore further?"
