      "content": "My Son was raped and we're struggling.\n\nI wasn't sure where I could discuss this, and I hope it's okay if I talk about our situation here. I'm a mom of three boys and a girl. My twins who are 26, my third son who is 23, and my young daughter, 12. They're all precious to me and I'm so proud of them. I was relatively young (22) when I married my husband and had our first children, but more than anything I love being a mom and raising my twin boys was such an amazing experience, and my husband and I always planned on three children, and after three years we welcomed our youngest son into the family. By nature my third son 'C' was so gentle, well-behaved, creative and a little shy, in contrast to the boisterous and outgoing personalities of his older brothers, 'A' and 'B' (daughter is D, and the fact their first names are in alphabetical order is entirely coincidental). All in all he was an extremely happy boy. By the time our boys were 14 and 11, hubby and I agreed on having one more child, and I finally had a daughter, which I was ecstatic by to have a little girl. Around that time, C started to become a lot more introverted and unsociable. He was so excited about being a big brother, and he's always so protective and caring of D, she thinks the world of him, so I knew jealously didn't alter his behavior, but he at an age where puberty was starting to hit so I wasn't really alarmed. However through his teen years he appeared to be getting worse. His grades were falling, he didn't appear to have many friends, and he was so reserved and secretive and he rarely spoke. He was never aggressive, he just always appeared to be sad. I was worried that he was being bullied be he wouldn't talk to me, every time I asked it was always just \"I'm alright\" and \"I'm doing fine\" followed by a false smile. I tried my best to help him, and he did pass school and went on to college, and for awhile it seemed like he was doing better to come out of his shell but there was still always part of him on the defence. When he was 22 he came out to me as gay, and I was honestly so relieved when he did because I thought he was finally opening to me and that this was the reason growing up seemed so difficult for him. He's fully out and open to everyone now, and seemed somewhat happier but he still had a very quiet and reserved side to him that at this point I believed was just his nature, but he was still really struggling in college and depressed. Last year after arriving home from work, my husband told me that C was upstairs and he had something extremely important to tell me. We went to his room and he was distressed and in tears, trying to hold it together. After a little time he finally confessed that he was assaulted sexually when he was 11. I don't know many details, all he's told me so far is that it was more than one stranger, and that it was violent. I cried so much with him, and I of course told him that this happens to so many people, it happens to children, it happens to men and it is never the victim's fault. He's seen a doctor, and he's been seeing a therapist for about 2 months now, but I can tell this is so hard on him. He still tries to put on a happy face most of the time but he's struggling. Every day I'm so afraid for his safety and well-being. \n\nI'm finding this so difficult to cope with myself. I feel like a failure for not protecting my child. I should of seen all of the early signs that something wasn't right. I want to be able to fix this, I want him to have his childhood back, but I know I can't do that, and it makes me feel useless. I'm ashamed of myself, I'm hurt that he felt like he couldn't trust me enough to tell me when he was still 11. I don't know how to fix an adult. I don't know what I'm asking for here either, I just need to cry and vent. Does anyone have advice on coping? Or is there anyone else here any experience with being the parent of a rape victim? \nI love him so much it hurts. \n\nEdit: I truly want to thank everyone who responded with such kindness and excellent advice. On my off breaks I have been looking into counselling for Myself and C's dad. This weekend we will have a serious discussion about our options. My Son is a strong, nurturing, intelligent and beautiful young man and while I know No one can take on and fight this turmoil for him (even though he needs a break), he won't be alone. We will support and love him. His best friend knows as well, so he has support outside this household too. "

      "content": "This is absolutely a safe space to discuss what you are going through. Thank you for the immense courage it took to share your story and the deep pain your family is enduring.\n\nPlease know that everything you are feeling right now\u2014the grief, the fear, the anger, the helplessness, and especially the crushing guilt\u2014is a completely normal and deeply human response to this devastating trauma.\n\nI am so incredibly sorry that your gentle, loving son, C, had to endure such a horrific experience, and I am so sorry that you, your husband, and your whole family are now carrying the weight of this secret that he kept hidden for so long.\n\nYou are not alone in this experience. Many parents of adult survivors feel exactly the way you do.\n\n### Addressing Your Feelings of Failure and Guilt\n\nLet us address the most painful part of your post first: the feeling that you failed him, that you should have seen the signs, and that you didn\u2019t protect him.\n\n**You did not fail your son.**\n\nThe symptoms you described\u2014the introversion, the secrecy, the sadness, the falling grades\u2014*were* the signs of the trauma. You saw them, you were worried about them, and you tried to help him by asking, talking, and offering support.\n\nThe reason you couldn't \"fix\" it or discover the root cause is because **abusers rely on secrecy and shame.**\n\n1.  **The Nature of Trauma:** When a child experiences violent assault, their brain enters survival mode. Often, the only way they can cope is to compartmentalize the event and keep it a secret. They often believe the assault was their fault, or they fear the consequences of disclosure (losing trust, being blamed, or causing distress to their parents).\n2.  **The Disguise:** The emotional fallout of trauma during adolescence looks indistinguishable from general depression, anxiety, or the typical growing pains of a shy teen. It is impossible for a loving parent to know the difference unless the child explicitly tells them.\n3.  **Your Success:** You spent over a decade loving, supporting, and creating a safe home for C. The fact that at age 22, he felt safe, loved, and trusted you enough to finally disclose this deeply shameful secret to you and your husband **is the definition of success.** You created the environment where healing could finally begin.\n\nYou are not useless. You are the foundation upon which your son is now building his recovery.\n\n### Understanding C\u2019s Healing Journey\n\nIt sounds like C is facing the hardest part of his journey: confronting the reality of the trauma he buried for so long.\n\n*   **Delayed Disclosure:** It is incredibly common for survivors, especially male survivors, to disclose years or even decades after the event. This time gap does not lessen the pain; it means the pain has been internalized and repressed, manifesting as depression and anxiety.\n*   **The Struggle is Good (Though Painful):** The fact that he is struggling now, two months into therapy, means the therapy is working. He is finally pulling the trauma out of the dark place where he stored it, and that process is messy, exhausting, and often feels worse before it gets better.\n*   **You Cannot Fix an Adult:** You are right, you cannot give him his childhood back, and you cannot \"fix\" him. What you can do is stand beside him, listen without judgment, believe his every word, and reinforce that he is safe and loved.\n\n### Advice on Coping for Parents (Secondary Survivors)\n\nYou are a secondary survivor, meaning you are experiencing trauma through the suffering of someone you love. You absolutely need your own support system.\n\n#### 1. Seek Your Own Counseling\n\nThis is the most critical piece of advice. You and your husband need a safe, neutral space to process the shock, the grief over the lost years, the anger at the perpetrators, and the guilt you are feeling\u2014**without burdening C.**\n\n*   Look for therapists who specialize in trauma or have experience working with family members of survivors.\n*   This is not selfish; it is essential. You cannot support C effectively in the long term if you are emotionally depleted and consumed by guilt.\n\n#### 2. Educate Yourself\n\nLearning about trauma responses, especially in male survivors, can help you understand that C\u2019s behavior is a symptom of injury, not a reflection of his personality or your parenting.\n\n*   Resources like RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) or local sexual assault service centers often have specific information for family members.\n*   Understanding that his healing path will be non-linear (good days followed by bad days) will help you manage your own anxiety.\n\n#### 3. Redefine Your Role\n\nYou are moving from the role of the protector of a child to the supportive anchor for an adult.\n\n*   **Listen, Don't Advise:** When C talks (if he chooses to), your job is to listen and validate his feelings (\"That sounds terrifying,\" \"I believe you,\" \"I love you\"). Do not offer solutions unless he asks for them.\n*   **Focus on the Present:** While you grieve the past, focus your energy on the strong, intelligent, nurturing young man he is today. Celebrate his small victories, whether it\u2019s getting out of bed, finishing a homework assignment, or making plans with his friend.\n*   **Maintain Normalcy:** Keep the household routine as normal as possible. Trauma thrives on chaos; routine provides safety and predictability.\n\n#### 4. Practice Self-Compassion\n\nYou are dealing with overwhelming grief. Be as kind to yourself as you are to C.\n\n*   **Acknowledge Your Effort:** Remind yourself daily: *I did the best I could with the information I had at the time.*\n*   **Take Breaks:** It is okay to step away, take a walk, or spend time with your husband or daughter (D and the twins) to recharge. You do not have to be \"on call\" for C 24/7.\n\nYou mentioned in your edit that you are already looking into counseling for yourself and your husband, and that C has the support of his best friend. This is incredible forward momentum. You are demonstrating immense strength and commitment to your family.\n\nYou are a loving mother, and your son is fortunate to have you fighting this battle alongside him. Hold onto your love for him\u2014it is the most powerful tool for healing."
