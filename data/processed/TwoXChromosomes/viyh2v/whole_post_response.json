      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing such deeply personal and painful feelings. It takes a lot of courage to talk about this, and I want you to know that I hear you and I take your distress seriously.\n\nWhat you are describing\u2014feeling numb during sex, going through the motions because he wants it, and then feeling \"dirty\" and crying afterward\u2014is a very clear sign that something is not right, and that you are experiencing emotional pain related to your intimate life and your relationship.\n\nPlease know that **you are not alone** in feeling this way, and your feelings are valid.\n\nLet's look at the different parts of what you shared:\n\n---\n\n### 1. The Physical and Emotional Reaction After Sex\n\nYou mentioned feeling \"sick,\" \"dirty,\" and crying afterward.\n\n*   **This disconnect between your actions (having sex) and your emotional state (numbness/distress) is likely causing these physical and emotional reactions.**\n*   The term you are describing is often referred to as **post-coital dysphoria (PCD)** or post-sex blues, which involves feelings of sadness, anxiety, agitation, or a need to withdraw immediately after intercourse. However, given the context you provided about your trauma and lack of desire, this is likely rooted in a deeper feeling of **violation or emotional distress.**\n*   When you feel compelled to have sex without genuine desire (\"I just do it because he wants it\"), your body and mind are essentially going through an experience that is not truly consensual on an emotional level. This can lead to feelings of being used, dirty, or violated, even if you intellectually agreed to the act.\n\n### 2. The Role of Trauma and Numbness\n\nYou mentioned childhood traumas and traumas from him, leading to feeling \"numb\" and difficulty expressing love.\n\n*   **Trauma often causes emotional numbing as a defense mechanism.** If you are numb and disconnected, it's a way your brain tries to protect you from feeling intense pain or vulnerability.\n*   In an intimate relationship, especially during sex, vulnerability is high. If you are approaching sex from a place of numbness and obligation, it is likely triggering your underlying trauma responses. The crying afterward is your body releasing the suppressed emotions and the pain of going through an experience you didn't truly want.\n\n### 3. Understanding Your Needs\n\nYou asked, \"Why am I not happy?\" and \"Can someone help me?\"\n\nYou are not happy because you are prioritizing your partner's wants over your own deeply held needs for safety, genuine connection, and true consent (which includes enthusiastic consent, not just passive compliance).\n\n---\n\n## Where to Go From Here: Steps for Support\n\nI cannot provide professional diagnosis or therapy, but I can offer resources and suggestions for immediate support and next steps.\n\n### Step 1: Prioritize Your Safety and Boundaries\n\nThe most important thing right now is to stop doing things that make you feel dirty or violated.\n\n*   **You have the absolute right to say \"no\" to sex, regardless of how long you have been together or whether he wants it.** Your feelings and comfort are paramount.\n*   **Communicate a pause:** You might need to tell your partner that you need to take a break from physical intimacy right now because you are struggling emotionally and need time to focus on your mental health. You don't have to blame him, but you must advocate for yourself. *(Example: \"I need to take a step back from sex for a while. I am feeling very overwhelmed and need to focus on my emotional well-being.\")*\n\n### Step 2: Seek Professional Support\n\nThe feelings you are experiencing\u2014the intense emotional numbing, the history of trauma, the distress after sex\u2014are complex and require professional help.\n\n*   **Trauma-Informed Therapist:** Look for a therapist who specializes in **trauma (especially Complex PTSD or C-PTSD)** and relationship issues. They can help you process your childhood trauma, understand how it affects your current relationships, and help you establish healthy boundaries.\n*   **Sexual Health Counselor:** A counselor specializing in sexual health or intimacy issues can help you explore the lack of arousal and the feelings of obligation during sex.\n\n### Step 3: Immediate Resources\n\nIf you feel overwhelmed or need to talk to someone right now, please use these resources. They are confidential and staffed by trained individuals:\n\n| Resource | Service |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **National Sexual Assault Hotline (RAINN)** | Confidential support for sexual trauma, boundaries, and relationship issues. |\n| **Call: 800-656-HOPE (4673)** | |\n| **Crisis Text Line** | Text HOME to 741741 (US/Canada) for free, confidential crisis support 24/7. |\n| **National Domestic Violence Hotline** | If you feel controlled or pressured in your relationship. |\n| **Call: 800-799-SAFE (7233)** | |\n\nYou deserve to feel safe, respected, and happy in your relationships, and especially in your own body. Please be gentle with yourself, and take the necessary steps to prioritize your healing.\n\n**What feels like the most accessible step for you to take right now?**"
