Is it immature of me (21f) to want to walk away from this friendship?\n\nShe is a 22f, I am a 21f and he is a 25m. \n\nI met him over a year ago in class. We were friends who I thought were pretty close. We hung out, I knew his friends and have met his family, and knew each other really well. We shared a lot of personal stuff. I considered him to be one of my best friends. I fell in love with him a few months after becoming friends with him. However, I knew he wasn't into me like that, plus I'm working through a lot of issues (PTSD and trying to get a bachelors [also a mental illness, imo]) so i know any serious relationship isn't right for me right now. Fast forward a year. He met my best friend. Had a crush on her instantly. My best friend knows how much I was in love with him. Just every choice she's made since then has been selfish from my eyes. Such as, being all over him in front of me. He cut me out of his life shortly after, completely shocking and devastasting me. He essentially told her (paraphrasing) when they afterward went on a date, \"I'm not attracted to her. Never have been. I knew she liked me but i like you so I dropped her. She was trying to make you look bad to win me over anyway, I want to date you.\"  She seems to be ok with this and is giving him a chance. I am devastated. I don't even know what to feel right now. She says I'm being immature and dramatic and I should just be happy for her. But I'm reeling from the loss of who I thought was one of my best friends-and his false accusations of me. And I'm also feeling shocked and kind of betrayed from her as well. Am i being immature or is this a bad friendship?\n\nEdit:\nIf this detail matters, she doesn't have a crush or any real interest in him. part of what makes it feel selfish to me. She is moving next year and just wants to have a \"fling\" relationship in the meantime. She gets plenty of male attention so I feel it's insensitive. "

      "content": "This sounds incredibly painful, complicated, and shocking. I want to start by saying that the feelings you are experiencing\u2014devastation, betrayal, shock, and anger\u2014are **completely valid and normal.** You are dealing with a massive amount of emotional fallout right now.\n\nYou are not just dealing with the rejection of a crush; you are dealing with:\n1. The abrupt, painful loss of someone you considered a close friend (the 25m).\n2. The sting of a cruel rejection and false accusations from him.\n3. A profound sense of betrayal from your best friend.\n4. The dismissal of your very real pain (\"immature and dramatic\").\n\nLet\u2019s break down your situation and address your questions directly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Am I being immature or is this a bad friendship?\n\nBased on the details you provided, **you are absolutely not being immature, and this dynamic is displaying serious signs of being a bad friendship right now.**\n\n### The Guy (25m)\n\nHis behavior was cruel and unnecessary. Cutting you out abruptly and then making false accusations (\"She was trying to make you look bad to win me over\") is a toxic way to handle a situation. He not only rejected you, but he actively damaged your reputation and your emotional well-being. The fact that he was willing to throw away a year-long friendship so easily shows a severe lack of respect and empathy for you.\n\n### The Best Friend (22f)\n\nA true best friend, even if they choose to date someone you were in love with, handles the situation with compassion, sensitivity, and respect for your pain.\n\n**Her actions show a significant lack of empathy:**\n\n*   **She prioritized a temporary fling:** This is the most critical detail. She knows the depth of your feelings, knows you are reeling from the loss of the relationship, and yet she is proceeding with him purely for a casual, short-term distraction before she moves. This demonstrates that her temporary amusement is more important than your long-term emotional stability.\n*   **She was overtly affectionate in front of you:** This is rubbing salt in the wound and shows a disregard for your comfort.\n*   **She is dismissing your pain:** Telling you that you are \"immature and dramatic\" and should \"just be happy for her\" is a form of emotional gaslighting. It forces you to question your own very real feelings and prevents you from processing the betrayal.\n\nA good friend would acknowledge your hurt, step away from the relationship, or at the very least, create significant distance and support you through your pain\u2014not participate in the source of it.\n\n**Conclusion:** Your friend is acting selfishly. Her reaction is not that of a supportive best friend.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Is it immature of me to want to walk away from this friendship?\n\n**No, it is not immature; it is an act of self-preservation and maturity.**\n\nMaturity is recognizing when a relationship is actively causing you harm and setting a necessary boundary to protect your peace.\n\nYou are currently dealing with serious issues (PTSD and the stress of your degree). Your focus needs to be on healing and stability. When a relationship\u2014even a lifelong one\u2014becomes a source of stress, betrayal, and pain, you have every right to step back.\n\n### Why Walking Away (or Taking Space) is the Mature Choice:\n\n1.  **You Need to Heal:** You cannot heal from the loss of the guy while your best friend is constantly reminding you of him, dismissing your feelings, and actively dating him. You need space to process the grief of losing *both* relationships.\n2.  **Protecting Your Boundaries:** Your friend has shown she is unwilling to respect your emotional boundaries. Walking away establishes that your well-being matters, even if she doesn't agree with your feelings.\n3.  **Focus on Recovery:** The emotional energy spent on this drama is draining energy you need for your health and studies. Walking away allows you to redirect that focus.\n\nYou do not owe anyone\u2014even a best friend\u2014access to your life if they are causing you significant emotional distress.\n\n---\n\n## What to Do Next\n\nYou are reeling right now, so focus on small steps.\n\n### 1. Create Distance Immediately\n\nWhether you decide to end the friendship forever or just take a long break, you need distance from both of them.\n\n*   **Limit Contact:** Stop answering her texts or calls for a defined period (e.g., three weeks). Tell her, \"I need space to process everything that has happened. I will reach out when I am ready.\"\n*   **Avoid Social Media:** Mute or block both of them temporarily so you aren't exposed to updates about their \"fling.\"\n*   **Do Not Engage in Arguments:** If she tries to call you \"dramatic\" again, do not defend yourself. Simply state, \"My feelings are valid, and I need space right now.\"\n\n### 2. Grieve the Losses\n\nAcknowledge that you are grieving two major losses: the future you imagined with the guy (and the loss of his friendship), and the relationship you thought you had with your best friend.\n\n*   Lean on other supportive friends, family members, or a therapist.\n*   Focus heavily on the healthy coping mechanisms you use for your PTSD.\n\n### 3. Define the Future\n\nAfter you have had a few weeks of distance, you can decide if the friendship is salvageable.\n\n*   **If you choose to end it:** You can send a final message explaining that her actions\u2014knowing your pain, choosing a casual fling over your friendship, and dismissing your trauma\u2014have shown you that the friendship is no longer healthy for you.\n*   **If you choose to pause it:** Maintain distance until she moves next year. If the friendship is meant to continue, you can revisit it after she is gone and the temporary drama has dissipated. But do not feel obligated to wait for her.\n\nYour priority right now is your mental health and your degree. Surround yourself with people who uplift you and respect your feelings, not people who actively participate in your pain. Take care of yourself."
