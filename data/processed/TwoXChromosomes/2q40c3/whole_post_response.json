Terrified and alone.\n\n When I was 19 and fresh out of inpatient treatment, I met a 25 year old man on Okay Cupid. I wasn't in a place to date him seriously, as I was transitioning from having no control at all (treatment) to finally figuring myself out. However, he pressured me again and again to date exclusively, and we ended up in a two year, horribly abusive relationship. \n\nThe first red flag:  one of the first times I spent the night, after passing out drunk, he took my phone and went through all my texts. A male friend texted me. In the morning, he threatened to kick me out. \n\nThis set a precedent for the rest of our relationship; he systematically found any social media account I had ever had, read what he wanted into my email and texts (male friends texting me; e-mails from photographers asking if I was comfortable with nudes) and would harass me about the information found afterward. When I say harass, I mean unending verbally abusive texts about me being a slut, untrustworthy etc, him never being able to trust me again. Calls and calls and calls. Unending. When I once told him I was changing all my passwords, he told me that was unacceptable because he \"needed\" them in order for me to prove I was loyal to him. \n\nI never cheated once. Not after he fucked me multiple times while I was passed out (I remember waking up in bed next to my best friend to him thrusting inside of me). Not after he shamed me for my clothes, telling me I was eliciting too much male attention with this shirt. That dress. Those shoes. Not after reducing me to only my sex. Not after shaking me and intimidating me during our arguments. \n\nAnd then it came. Two years, a horrible eating disorder, shattered self-esteem later...we broke up. I thought I could finally rest and order myself together like I've honestly needed to since I was 19. Nope. Last night, he broke into an old dating site of mine. He swept through everything. He texted me non-stop about what I whore I was. Said he was glad to know he was right all along, that I wasn't to be trusted and I betrayed him. Note: every message sent on that dating profile occurred after our break up. Further note: his betrayal refers to us talking about how we would use the time a part to work on ourselves and become healthier people. A part of that was not pursuing anyone romantically (though no mentions of sexually). I wasn't pursuing anyone. I have very low self-esteem and when I am alone I use online men to validate what I perceive to be a disgusting, unloveable girl.\n\nHe has locked me out of it so I can't delete it. I have been getting increasingly sexual text messages from men I don't know all day. I am afraid he is impersonating me and baiting them into harassing me. I am so overwhelmed. \n\nOn top of this, I have a severe eating disorder and social anxiety, which our two years together only made worse (i.e. him reducing me to only the sex I was or was not having). I feel worthless. I feel afraid, of him, and of his words - what if he's right and I really am just a whore? I honestly don't know what to do. \n"

      "content": "This sounds absolutely terrifying and deeply overwhelming. Please know that what you are experiencing is **abuse**, and it is completely understandable that you feel terrified, alone, and worthless right now.\n\nI want to start by saying this clearly: **You are not a whore. You are not worthless.** Your ex is a malicious, abusive person, and his words are designed to control and hurt you. They are lies. What he is doing\u2014breaking into your accounts, harassing you, and orchestrating harassment from strangers\u2014is illegal and completely unacceptable.\n\nYou have survived a horrifically abusive relationship, and that takes immense strength. Now, we need to focus on your safety and well-being.\n\nLet's break down what is happening and look at some immediate steps we can take, focusing on safety first, and then on emotional support.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Safety and Technical Steps\n\nYou are right to be concerned that he is impersonating you and baiting men to harass you. We need to try and shut down his access and limit the damage.\n\n### 1. Document Everything\n\nBefore doing anything else, if you can, take screenshots of everything:\n*   The texts he sent you after breaking in.\n*   The sexual text messages you are receiving from unknown numbers.\n*   Any evidence you can gather of his activity.\n*   The dates and times of these incidents.\n\n**This documentation is crucial if you decide to involve the police or seek a restraining order.**\n\n### 2. Address the Hacked Dating Profile\n\nSince he changed the password and locked you out, you need to contact the platform directly.\n\n*   **Identify the dating site (e.g., OkCupid, Hinge, etc.).**\n*   **Look for their \"Help\" or \"Support\" center.** Search specifically for \"account takeover,\" \"hacked account,\" or \"impersonation.\"\n*   **Contact them and explain the situation clearly:** State that your ex-partner has illegally accessed your account, changed the password, and is now impersonating you to solicit harassment from other users.\n*   **Ask them to freeze or immediately delete the account.** They should have procedures for dealing with abuse and account takeovers.\n\n### 3. Change ALL Other Passwords\n\nSince he has a history of accessing your accounts, you must assume he knows the passwords to everything else.\n\n*   Change the passwords for your primary email (this is often the \"key\" to resetting other accounts).\n*   Change passwords for social media (Facebook, Instagram, etc.).\n*   Change the password for your phone carrier account (if possible).\n*   **Use strong, unique passwords that are not related to each other.** Consider using a password manager.\n*   **Activate Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) on every single account possible.** This means that even if he knows the password, he cannot log in without a code sent to your physical phone.\n\n### 4. Block and Silence the Harassment\n\n*   **Block your ex's number immediately.** Do not read, respond, or engage with any communication from him. Every message is designed to provoke a reaction.\n*   **Block the unknown numbers sending sexual texts.** If you have an iPhone, you can filter messages from unknown senders into a separate folder so you don't have to see them pop up.\n\n---\n\n## Safety Planning and Legal Options\n\nYou are in danger of continued harassment and stalking.\n\n### 1. Contact a Domestic Violence Hotline\n\nYou do not have to be physically harmed to seek help from a domestic violence organization. What you are experiencing is emotional, psychological, and digital abuse/stalking. They can help you create a concrete safety plan and navigate local legal options.\n\n*   **National Domestic Violence Hotline:**\n    *   Call: 800-799-7233 (SAFE)\n    *   Text: \"START\" to 88788\n    *   They are available 24/7, free, and confidential.\n\n### 2. Consider a Restraining Order\n\nA domestic violence advocate can help you explore applying for a Protection Order or Restraining Order. This order can legally mandate that he stop contacting you, stop harassing you, and stop accessing your accounts. The documentation you collected (texts, proof of hacking) will be important here.\n\n### 3. Report to the Police\n\nWhat he is doing\u2014unauthorized access to a computer system (hacking) and stalking/harassment\u2014is a crime. You can file a police report. If you are hesitant, a DV advocate can accompany you or help you prepare the report.\n\n---\n\n## Emotional Support and Self-Care\n\nIt is completely normal to feel worthless, afraid, and doubt yourself after years of systematic abuse and gaslighting.\n\n### 1. Reality Check: His Words Are Abuse\n\n**His goal is to destroy your self-worth so you feel dependent on him or so broken you cannot move on.**\n\n*   He is using your past history (the dating profile) to justify his current, illegal behavior.\n*   You broke up. You are allowed to live your life.\n*   The fact that he continues to monitor, harass, and stalk you *after* the relationship ended proves that the problem is **him**, not you. His actions are not about loyalty; they are about **control**.\n\n### 2. Focus on Your Mental Health\n\nYou mentioned struggling with an eating disorder and social anxiety, which this horrific situation is undoubtedly exacerbating.\n\n*   **Reach out to a trusted professional.** If you have a therapist or doctor, contact them immediately and tell them what is happening. This is a crisis, and you need extra support right now.\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741 for confidential, free support.\n*   **Keep your immediate environment safe.** If you can, spend time with a trusted friend or family member who can physically be with you and support you while you deal with the technical steps.\n\n**Please prioritize your safety and well-being. You deserve to be safe, respected, and free from this man's toxic control.**\n\nWhich of these steps feels most manageable for you to tackle first? We can focus on that."
