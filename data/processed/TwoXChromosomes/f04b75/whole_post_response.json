We were together for 7 years (HS sweethearts) and in our 20's, we lived together for 5 years and have 2 dogs. Last night I went to sleep cuddled up on him like always, everything was normal yesterday and today suddenly I got hit by the \"talk\" after lunch.\n\nSo he's always loved the idea of blowjobs but since I was his first gf he's never gotten one, because my boundaries state that I DO NOT DO BJ'S. Why? Because I was forced to give them to entire groups of boys in junior high, I was coerced, they had pictures of me naked that I sent to someone I trusted. It started out with only one guy but he brought friends once and so on and so forth. I don't really want to go into any more detail. The issue is solved, police were involved.\n\nHe knows this is what happened and the reason I don't want to give BJ's anymore, at first he was ok with this but sometimes he would slip and ask me if I'd be willing to try it, I always said no. He respected that for like 3 years until late 2019 when he asked again and I again said NO. It made me sad, I would instantly cry when he brought it up and last year was no exception even though it had been so long since the last time.\n\nToday he sat me down and asked me if I still felt this way and when I said I did he asked me to try therapy. I asked for what? I don't *need* therapy, I just want to keep penises away from my god damn face. He said this was selfish and that if I'm not willing to fix my problems with penises that we could no longer be together, then he got up and left, told me to think about it and he will be back tomorrow.\n\nHe said he read various posts online about people in unfulfilled marriages and partnerships where everyone always replied to the OP that they should dump their partners because life is too short or something to be sexually unsatisfied. I don't think this is fair, it can't be that important to want to leave me. I'll do literally anything else he asks in the bedroom except for this, how can it be a dealbreaker?? Not like I'm not having any sex at all with him.\n\nAnyhow I'm super frustrated and don't really have anyone to talk to about this, it's just too humiliating. If anyone can offer advice I'd be truly grateful. Thanks TwoX."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult, painful, and frankly, infuriating situation. Please know that what you are feeling\u2014anger, sadness, frustration, and humiliation\u2014is completely valid.\n\nI want to start by saying this clearly: **You are not dumb. Your boundaries are valid. You have done absolutely nothing wrong.**\n\nIt takes immense courage to share that history, and I am so sorry that you went through such horrifying trauma in junior high. The fact that you have survived that, involved the police, and established a clear boundary to protect yourself is a sign of strength, not a flaw.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack what happened today, because this is not about a lack of sexual fulfillment\u2014it is about a lack of respect and empathy.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Your Boyfriend's Actions\n\n### 1. The Boundary is Non-Negotiable\n\nA boundary established due to severe sexual trauma is not something you \"fix\" for your partner's pleasure. It is a fundamental safety mechanism.\n\nYour boyfriend knew the history. He knew the reason you won't perform BJs. For him to frame your trauma-informed boundary as a \"problem\" that *you* must \"fix\" (via therapy) so that *he* can be satisfied is not only deeply selfish, it is manipulative and minimizes the profound pain you experienced.\n\n**You do not owe him an explanation, nor do you owe him access to your body in a way that triggers your trauma.**\n\n### 2. The Coercion and Manipulation\n\nWhen he used the threat of leaving (\"if I'm not willing to fix my problems with penises that we could no longer be together\"), he was attempting to coerce you into violating your own boundaries by using the relationship as leverage.\n\nHe is essentially saying: \"My desire for this specific act is more important than your physical and emotional safety.\"\n\nThis is not a loving partner. A loving partner would recognize the historical context, respect the boundary, and feel terrible that you went through that trauma. They would never use it as a weapon or a condition for the relationship.\n\n### 3. The \"Dealbreaker\"\n\nYou asked how this can be a dealbreaker when you are willing to do everything else.\n\nThe problem here is not the sex act itself; the problem is what his demand reveals about his character.\n\n*   **For him, the dealbreaker is not the lack of oral sex; the dealbreaker is your refusal to prioritize his desire over your trauma.**\n*   He is showing you that his needs, even for a specific, non-essential sexual act, outweigh your need for safety and autonomy.\n\nHe is hiding behind vague online advice (\"life is too short to be sexually unsatisfied\") to justify demanding that you override a serious trauma boundary. This is a massive red flag that you would eventually have encountered in other areas of life.\n\n---\n\n## Advice for Tomorrow and Beyond\n\nHe told you to think about it and that he will be back tomorrow. This gives you a critical 24 hours to decide how *you* want to proceed.\n\n### 1. Reframe the Conversation\n\nWhen he returns, do not plead, cry, or try to convince him that you are worth staying for. Do not offer compromises or suggest you will try therapy for *his* sake.\n\nIf he is truly willing to end a 7-year relationship over this, he has shown you exactly who he is. You can use his ultimatum against him.\n\n**What you can say (if you choose to speak to him):**\n\n*   \"I have thought about it. Your decision to end our 7-year relationship because I refuse to violate a boundary established due to past sexual assault tells me everything I need to know about your priorities. I will not be seeking therapy to change my boundaries for your sexual fulfillment.\"\n*   \"I am not interested in being with someone who calls me selfish for protecting myself from triggers related to trauma.\"\n*   \"The relationship is over. We need to focus on logistics.\"\n\n### 2. Focus on Logistics (The Dogs and the Home)\n\nThis is the hard part, but you need to switch into practical mode immediately.\n\n*   **Who is staying and who is leaving?** Since you lived there for 5 years, start gathering any important documents (financial, leases, etc.).\n*   **The Dogs:** This will be heart-wrenching. You need to decide who is taking primary ownership and who will handle visitation, or if one of you will take both. Start documenting vet records and ownership history if necessary.\n*   **Support System:** Humiliation is a powerful feeling, but please try to reach out to a trusted friend or family member, even if you just tell them the breakup happened without going into the specifics of *why*. You need people around you right now.\n\n### 3. Seek Support for Yourself\n\nWhile you are right that you don't \"need\" therapy to change your boundaries, you *have* just been through a massive, traumatic breakup, and you have significant past trauma. Therapy or a support group could be immensely beneficial for *you*\u2014not to change your feelings about BJs, but to process the betrayal, the loss of the relationship, and the pain of having your boundaries so cruelly disrespected.\n\n**You deserve a partner who sees your survival as a testament to your strength, not an obstacle to his pleasure.** This breakup is painful, but it is protecting you from a lifetime of being with someone who would have consistently failed to respect your safety when it conflicted with his wants."
