I hate the fact that we are basically alive incubators. Our pelvis is designed to shit out babies. Our vagina is lubricated so the male dick can slide in. Our boobs are for feeding babies and male looks. I sometimes literally feel dirty and repulsed bc i have boobs and a vagina. I hate that every man wants to get inside me and have sex with me. And we dont even orgasm that much from PIV sex, like you give us vaginas and then we cant even come from straight sex with men? What a joke, as least mother nature blessed us with a clitoris so we can have at least some fun out of life lol. \n\nOur design isnt even that good tbh. Especially when talking about pregnancy. Human pregnancy looks like something straight up out of a horror movie. Blood splashing everwhere, the mother is in incredible pain, the baby is crying, sounds like a murder scene but naw its Just how it is. Animal mothers give birth easily. Horses literally give birth standing up, and the baby is ready to go, it walks already. Our babies require non stop attention, you Gotta watch out for their mushy ass head and it doesnt even walk until like 2 years old. And our babies are TOO BIG they tear apart our vagina and we have to get stitches. Like, we could pop out a baby size of an egg and it could grow overtime but nawww its Gotta be BIG. \n\nI also hate the way women are naturally more submissive and shy and prone to manipulation. I hate how we are more emotional. I hate how weak our bodies are. Naturally. Male bodies are made for running, being athletic, strong, they develop muscles easily, we dont. Our bodies develop FAT easily. At least in animal kingdom females and males are more so the same in size and females are strong and hunt. For example lionesses, they are the hunters, they can fight of male lions if necessary. Female horses can fight off horny males by delivering a fatal kick in the head. But we are weak, we cant fight off rapists and murderers. I hate it. At least we could have some sort of barbed wire vagina, to prevent rapists but nawwww we cant have nothing. We rely on other males to protect us bc we be too weak. And they are our natural predarors. We are like gazelles and they are the lions. We should be wary of them but instead we are attracted to them. Its crazy. The gazelles hate lions but they want to be them. Bc Lions are in charge. \n\nIdk i really am sad. Sometimes i think, what did I do to deserve this. Why am I naturally like this. I want to feel better about myself but idk what to do. I want to feel good inside my body but I Just cant. Anyone else suffering from internalized mysogyny?"

      "content": "This is a incredibly raw, intense, and honest rant, and I want to thank you for sharing it. It takes immense courage to put feelings this painful and visceral into words.\n\nPlease know that **what you are describing is not insane, and you are far from alone.** The feelings you are experiencing\u2014the deep sense of repulsion, the frustration with biological vulnerability, the anger at feeling defined by reproductive function\u2014are classic, painful symptoms of internalized misogyny.\n\nIt sounds like you are carrying an incredible weight of anger and sadness, stemming from living in a world that often defines the female body through the lens of male desire, reproduction, and perceived weakness.\n\nLet\u2019s acknowledge some of the core pain points you raised:\n\n### 1. The Burden of Biological Function\n\nYou articulated a profound frustration with the biological design of the female body\u2014feeling like an \"incubator\" whose organs exist primarily for others (male pleasure, baby feeding).\n\n**It is absolutely valid to feel angry that your body\u2019s design is painful and demanding.** The complaints you have about human childbirth (the pain, the tearing, the vulnerability) and the frustration with PIV sex (the lack of reliable orgasm) are incredibly common frustrations shared by countless women throughout history.\n\nWhen you say, \"Our design isn\u2019t even that good,\" you are challenging a narrative that often insists the female body must be passively accepted, even when it causes immense pain or restricts freedom. Your anger is a sign that you value your own comfort, autonomy, and pleasure, and you are rightfully upset when biology or societal expectations seem to take those things away.\n\n### 2. The Fear of Vulnerability and Objectification\n\nThe comparison to gazelles and lions is heartbreaking because it captures the fundamental fear many women live with: the knowledge that we are often physically weaker than potential aggressors, and that our bodies are targets.\n\nYou hate feeling weak, and you hate the feeling of being constantly \"wanted\" or objectified. This often makes the body feel like a liability or a prison, rather than a home.\n\nWhen society minimizes female strength and maximizes male threat, it is natural to internalize that weakness and feel repulsed by the body that seems incapable of ultimate self-defense. Your desire for a \"barbed wire vagina\" is a powerful expression of wanting boundaries, protection, and the ability to control who accesses your body.\n\n### 3. Internalized Misogyny: Understanding the Root\n\nYou named this feeling accurately. Internalized misogyny is when we absorb the negative, limiting, and often hateful messages about women and womanhood that permeate our culture, and then turn that hatred inward toward ourselves.\n\n**You don't naturally hate your body.** You have been exposed to a societal blueprint that says:\n*   Female bodies are primarily sexual objects (boobs for \"male looks\").\n*   Female bodies are flawed (easy fat development, emotionality).\n*   Female bodies are weak and require male protection.\n\nWhen you look in the mirror and feel repulsion, you are not seeing yourself; you are seeing the reflection of centuries of devaluing and limiting cultural narratives. It is exhausting and painful to constantly fight the feeling that you are inherently lesser, weaker, or dirtier just because you are female.\n\n---\n\n### Where Do You Go From Here?\n\nYou asked, \"What do I do?\" and \"How can I feel better about myself?\"\n\nHealing from internalized misogyny is a long process that requires shifting focus from *what* your body is, to *what* your body does, and challenging the sources of those hateful messages.\n\n**1. Challenge the Purpose:**\nStart questioning the idea that your body *must* serve a specific purpose (reproduction, male pleasure). Your body exists for *you*. What brings you comfort? What movements feel good? What sensory experiences make you feel alive? Focus on function and sensation *for yourself*, not for others.\n\n**2. Find Strong Female Narratives (Beyond the Physical):**\nYou admire the lioness hunter and the horse that can deliver a fatal kick. In human terms, strength is much broader. Start consuming content (books, documentaries, history) that focuses on women who exhibit resilience, intellectual power, communal strength, and strategic thinking. This helps reframe what \"female strength\" looks like outside of muscle mass.\n\n**3. Seek Community and Shared Experience:**\nA huge part of healing is realizing these feelings aren't unique to you. Find spaces (online forums, support groups, books on feminism or gender studies) where women are openly discussing their anger at biological limitations, objectification, and the pressure of motherhood/sexuality. When you hear others validate your exact frustrations, it lessens the feeling that you are \"insane.\"\n\n**4. Professional Support:**\nGiven the intensity of the self-hatred and the feeling of disgust (\"I sometimes literally feel dirty and repulsed\"), this might be a good time to speak with a therapist who specializes in body image issues, gender identity, or trauma. They can provide tools to help you decouple your self-worth from societal expectations about your physical form and function.\n\nPlease be gentle with yourself. You are processing deep, systemic pain, and it is okay to be angry and sad about the hand you feel you were dealt. Your feelings are valid, and you deserve to feel safe and comfortable in your own skin."
