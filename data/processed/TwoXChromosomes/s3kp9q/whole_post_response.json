If you were, how do you cope?\n\nTl;Dr at the bottom. \n\n\nGrooming is one of those topics I see pop up here every so often and it's shocking how common it is. I myself am just one of many cases and it continues to haunt me more than 15 years later. \n\nI [now 33F] was 12 and he was 22 and we \"met\" online. I told him in the beginning that I was 16 (as if that somehow made it better) but eventually told him the truth about my age and the \"relationship\" continued. Until I was 17.\n\nMy parents were getting divorced, I was lonely and felt neglected and it was nice I could have someone to talk to. Even if it often became sexual. \n\nHe often talked about marrying me, what our children would be like and painted this whole life together. He eventually became very possessive and would often force me to stay up into the wee hours of the morning on the phone with him even though I might've had school the next day. \n\nMore than once I tried to break it off with him and explained that I felt like I was being robbed of my childhood. His response would always be something manipulative and I would remain with him. \n\nMy parents knew. Maybe not the full extent of things since I wasn't comfortable to come out and say these things aloud (I'm still not). After my parents divorce, I stayed with my mom. She never tried to put a stop to it or explain why this relationship was wrong. I don't think this was due to negligence or shitty parenting - I think she just didn't know how to handle it and had so many other things going on at that time. And I wonder, if she had taken the time to sit down and talk to me about it, would I have listened? I don't know.\n\nYears later it still bothers me. Most days I don't think about it. I'm in a much better place in my life, in a good and healthy relationship, and have a better relationship with my parents now that I'm older and they're thankfully long divorced. We never talk about it and tbh I don't want to talk about it. It always makes me feel a little nauseous and dirty.\n\nSince it's disgustingly common, if you or someone you knew was groomed, how do you live with it? How do you forget about it and move on with your life? All I want is for it to be buried so deep it becomes forgotten. But here I am - 5:30 in the morning making this post because I woke up and for whatever reason, the memory of this horrible experience popped into my head.\n\nTl;Dr - was groomed. Scarred for life. Asking others that might've been in a similar situation how they live with these *feelings*?"

      "content": "I am so deeply sorry that you went through this horrific experience. Thank you for the immense courage it took to write this out, especially during an early morning moment of distress. It is completely understandable that this trauma continues to haunt you.\n\nWhat you are describing\u2014the manipulation, the isolation, the possessiveness, and the resulting feeling of being \"dirty\" and nauseous years later\u2014is the painful reality of grooming. You are right; it is disgustingly common, and the long-term emotional scars are profound.\n\nPlease know this immediately: **The shame, the fault, and the blame belong entirely to the perpetrator. You were a child who was manipulated and exploited.**\n\nYou asked a powerful question: How do you live with these feelings? How do you forget about it and move on?\n\nThe desire to bury the memory so deep it is forgotten is a completely natural defense mechanism against overwhelming pain. However, trauma often doesn't allow itself to be simply buried. When we try to suppress painful memories, they often resurface unexpectedly, just as happened to you this morning.\n\nCoping with the long-term effects of trauma is usually a process of *integration* and *reducing the emotional power* of the memory, rather than achieving total oblivion.\n\nHere are some perspectives and coping strategies that many survivors find helpful for processing those heavy feelings:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Separate the Past Self from the Present Self\n\nIt is crucial to recognize the difference between the 12-year-old girl who was manipulated and the successful, healthy 33-year-old woman you are today.\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Victimization:** The 12-year-old was lonely, seeking connection, and exploited by an adult who knew exactly what they were doing. You did not choose this experience; it was inflicted upon you.\n*   **Challenge the Feeling of \"Dirty\":** This feeling is a residual effect of the trauma and the manipulation. The perpetrator uses shame to keep victims silent. You are not dirty. You are a survivor who was violated. The feeling of disgust is valid, but it should be directed at the abuser\u2019s actions, not at your own inherent worth.\n\n### 2. Validate Your Current Strength\n\nYou mentioned that you are in a much better place, in a good and healthy relationship, and have repaired your relationship with your parents. This is not incidental; this shows incredible strength and resilience.\n\nWhen the memory pops up, try to gently anchor yourself in the *now*:\n\n*   \"That happened to me, but I am safe now.\"\n*   \"I am 33, I am loved, and I am in control of my life.\"\n*   \"The man who did that is no longer part of my reality.\"\n\n### 3. Processing the Intrusive Thoughts\n\nIntrusive thoughts often appear when you are tired, relaxed, or when your mind is not occupied (like at 5:30 AM). When the memory surfaces, try these immediate coping methods:\n\n*   **Grounding Techniques:** Use the 5-4-3-2-1 technique to pull yourself back to the present moment. (Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste.) This interrupts the emotional spiral.\n*   **Containment:** Some people find it helpful to imagine placing the memory into a locked box or drawer. You acknowledge it briefly (\"I see you, painful memory, but I am not dealing with you right now\") and then firmly decide to focus on a present activity (a cup of tea, a pet, a task).\n\n### 4. Considering Trauma-Informed Therapy\n\nYou mentioned that you don't want to talk about it, and that is a very common reaction to trauma. However, if the memory is still causing physical nausea and disrupting your sleep 15 years later, it suggests that the trauma is still stored in your body and mind in a way that is highly distressing.\n\nTherapy, particularly trauma-informed approaches, doesn't always require you to narrate the full story repeatedly. The goal is to process the memory so it becomes just that\u2014a memory\u2014rather than a terrifying, emotionally charged event that feels like it\u2019s happening now.\n\nSpecialized therapies that focus on reprocessing trauma include:\n\n*   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** Highly effective for reducing the emotional charge of traumatic memories without extensive talking.\n*   **Somatic Experiencing:** Focuses on how trauma is held in the body, helping to release physical symptoms like nausea or tension.\n\nProcessing this doesn't mean you have to tell your parents or your partner every detail (unless you choose to). It means giving yourself permission to work through those residual feelings of disgust and fear with a professional who is trained to hold that space safely.\n\n### 5. Dealing with the Parental Aspect\n\nYou touched on your mother's lack of intervention, noting that she was likely overwhelmed and didn't know how to handle it. It is completely valid to hold complex feelings about that\u2014grief over the lack of protection, and simultaneous understanding of her limitations.\n\nIf you are open to it, a therapist can help you process that secondary pain\u2014the feeling of neglect or lack of safety\u2014which often exacerbates the trauma of the grooming itself.\n\n---\n\nPlease be incredibly gentle with yourself today. What you endured was abuse, and the feelings you have are a normal response to an abnormal, terrible situation.\n\nIf you are feeling overwhelmed right now, please reach out to a support line.
