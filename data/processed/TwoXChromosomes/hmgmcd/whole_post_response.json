I went over to his place and we started doing things and he put a condom on and I told him that I didn\u2019t want to have sex with that day because I didn\u2019t feel ready but still he tried to but I was too nervous and my body didn\u2019t let him in. After this he acted hurt and shit saying that he wasn\u2019t attractive enough or whatever but really I felt like shit and now I don\u2019t wanna have sex with him or do stuff with him. I told him that I felt like he didn\u2019t care about what I told him and he said he knows that he went over the limit and that he is sorry and that it will never happen again but I really trusted him before and I would have never even thought he wouldn\u2019t stop when I told him no and now he really lost my trust. \n\nNow I don\u2019t know what to do because he says he really loves me and I love him too but this kinda made me reevaluate our relationship and I wanna give him another chance but I don\u2019t really feel good anymore but he thinks I moved on and that everything is good.\n\nedit: actually I told him again that I was bothered that he cared so little so we talked about it again and I told him how I felt and I had no reply and he only said he is sorry and understands what he did wrong. After that we went in self quarantine because in his friend group there was a person with COVID, ( luckily he doesn\u2019t have it) and in that time I thought I didn\u2019t feel anything for him anymore and so I tried to broke up with him but he insisted on seeing eachother one last time and now I\u2019m reconsidering going back together because I will miss him and I\u2019m not ready. I know what he did was wrong but I am just not strong enough to break it and I need advice\n\nand also he is really emotional and I think this might break him bc he started crying begging for a second chance when talked through the phone and met and he said that he loves me more than he ever loved and that we would rather never have sex than to break up and that he is willing to change everything to be back with me and I don\u2019t know if I should believe him or not"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly confusing, painful, and scary. I want to start by acknowledging how brave you are for sharing this story and asking for help. What you experienced is serious, and it is completely understandable that you are questioning everything right now.\n\nI also want to be very clear: **What happened was not your fault.** When you told him \"no\" or that you weren't ready, and he continued to try, he violated your boundaries. This is non-consensual behavior. It is a violation of trust, and your feelings that this was wrong are valid.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the situation and address your feelings and options.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating Your Experience and Feelings\n\n### The Incident (Sexual Assault/Boundary Violation)\nYou set a clear boundary: \"I told him that I didn\u2019t want to have sex with that day because I didn\u2019t feel ready.\"\n\n**Consent must be enthusiastic, ongoing, and can be withdrawn at any time.** When he continued trying after you said no, he disregarded your decision.\n\n*   **His Reaction Was Manipulative:** When he acted \"hurt and shit saying that he wasn\u2019t attractive enough,\" he was shifting the focus from his own violation to your perceived rejection of him. This is a common tactic to make the victim feel guilty, which is why you ended up feeling like \"shit.\" His feelings about his attractiveness are irrelevant compared to your right to say no.\n\n### Your Current Feelings\nThe fact that you feel uncomfortable, don't want to do stuff with him, and tried to break up with him shows that your intuition is working hard to protect you.\n\n*   **\"I don\u2019t really feel good anymore\"**\n*   **\"he really lost my trust\"**\n\nThese feelings are the direct result of his actions. They are not feelings you can simply talk away or ignore. A relationship cannot function without trust and safety.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Addressing Your Dilemma: Love vs. Trust\n\nYou are stuck in a painful place because you love him and have history, but the trust is gone. You are also struggling because you feel responsible for his emotions.\n\n### Your Responsibility vs. His Responsibility\n\nYou mentioned that you are worried this might \"break him\" because he is very emotional and was crying and begging.\n\n**It is not your job to manage his emotions or protect him from the consequences of his actions.**\n\n*   He is heartbroken because he is losing a relationship due to a serious mistake *he* made.\n*   Your job is to protect *yourself*. If you stay with him solely because you pity him or fear his sadness, you are sacrificing your own safety and well-being.\n*   His promises (\"I would rather never have sex than to break up,\" \"I am willing to change everything\") are easy to make in the moment when he is facing a breakup, but they do not immediately rebuild the trust he shattered.\n\n### Reconsidering the Breakup\n\nYou tried to break up, but his insistence and emotional pleas made you reconsider because you will miss him and \"you\u2019re not ready.\"\n\nYou are allowed to miss him. You are allowed to feel sad about losing the idea of the relationship you had. But missing him does not mean the relationship is healthy or safe to continue.\n\n**If you go back to him, you are agreeing to a relationship where you now know he has crossed a sexual boundary and then used emotional pressure (guilt, tears) to keep you from leaving.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. What You Need to Do Now\n\nYou asked for advice on what to do. Here are steps focused on prioritizing your well-being:\n\n### Step 1: Prioritize Your Safety and Space\n\nYour first priority must be your own emotional and physical well-being.\n\n*   **Get Space:** The fact that you felt better and clearer during self-quarantine shows that distance helped you see the situation clearly. You need that space again. Do not meet him \"one last time\" if you are not prepared to be firm. Emotional goodbyes often lead to pressure and regret.\n*   **Do Not Rush:** You do not have to decide today if you are breaking up for good, but you absolutely must decide to **pause** the relationship indefinitely to give yourself time to process what happened without his influence.\n\n### Step 2: Make a Decision Based on Your Feelings, Not His\n\nAsk yourself these questions honestly:\n\n1.  **Do I feel safe with him now?** (Safety means both physically and emotionally\u2014can you trust him to respect your boundaries?)\n2.  **Do I want to rebuild trust with him?** (Trust is the hardest thing to rebuild after a violation. Are you willing to do the emotional labor required, knowing he might slip up again?)\n3.  **Am I only staying because I feel guilty or sorry for him?** (If the answer is yes, you need to end it.)\n\nIf the thought of being physical with him or even being alone with him makes you anxious or uncomfortable, you have your answer. You should not be in a relationship that makes you feel bad or anxious.\n\n### Step 3: If You Decide to Break Up, Be Firm\n\nIf you decide to end the relationship (which seems like what your instincts are telling you), you need to make the breakup definitive and minimize the opportunity for him to pressure you.\n\n*   **Do Not Do It In Person:** Since he is highly emotional and has already used tears and begging to change your mind, breaking up over the phone, through text, or via email is often the safest and most effective way to maintain your resolve.\n*   **Keep the Message Simple and Final:** Do not get drawn into a debate about whether he is a good person or whether he meant to hurt you. Focus on the core fact: **The trust is gone.**\n\n**Example of what you could say:**\n*\"I know this is painful, but I have thought about it carefully, and I need to end our relationship. What happened when I said no fundamentally broke my trust, and I cannot move forward. I need to take care of myself now. I wish you well, but please do not contact me.\"*\n\n---\n\n## Resources for Support\n\nYou do not have to go through this alone. Talking to a professional can help you navigate the trauma and the guilt you feel.\n\n*   **If you are in the US, you can contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline:**\n    *   Call 800-656-HOPE (24/7)\n    *   Chat online at [hotline.rainn.org](https://hotline.rainn.org)\n\nYou are strong enough to make the right decision for yourself. Trust your gut\u2014it is telling you that something fundamentally wrong happened, and you deserve a partner who respects you completely, without question, every time."
