We started dating when I was 16, he proposed when I was 20, got married at 24. He\u2019s always had a passion for computer programming and graduated college to be a software developer in 2019. He got a job with a start up company right out of college and loved it there, but his boss and him didn\u2019t see eye to eye, and after a year or so he was laid off for the company \u201cnot having enough work\u201d and needing to cut back their employees. \n\nHe got another job shortly after but it was a temporary position working on a project. Only lasted a few months. \n\nWe got married in October 2021, and he was laid off from that temp position in December 2021. He hasn\u2019t had a job since. \n\nI 100% believe he\u2019s trying his best, he\u2019s had countless interviews with software companies and others that are a bit out of his scope, but he was desperate. He\u2019s applied to retail/minimum wage jobs over the last year as well, because he needs SOMETHING, also with no luck. I know the job market where I live right now is ridiculous, and even more ridiculous in his field since COVID, but I don\u2019t know how much more of this I can take. I physically don\u2019t make enough money to support the two of us. The last 2 years I\u2019ve taken a higher paying job and have been working insane amounts of overtime just to get bills paid, but as of a few weeks ago, overtime is no longer available. Today was the first time we flat out couldn\u2019t pay bills, and he was upset with me for not budgeting better. \n\nI truly love this man but I can\u2019t keep living like this. We already live with my parents in a cramped basement and we\u2019re both extremely depressed. This isn\u2019t how I wanted my marriage to start out. I feel myself slowly building resentment towards him for this situation."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly stressful and painful. It\u2019s completely understandable that you feel like you are at the end of your rope. You've been carrying an immense burden for a long time, and the fact that you love your husband makes this situation even more complicated and heartbreaking.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge how much you have done. Taking a higher-paying job, working \"insane amounts of overtime,\" and trying to keep everything afloat for two years shows incredible dedication and resilience. You have been fighting extremely hard for your marriage and your financial stability.\n\nIt is absolutely normal to feel resentment when you are sacrificing so much and things are still falling apart, especially when the situation feels out of your control. Living in a cramped basement with your parents, being financially strained, and both of you dealing with depression is a pressure cooker environment. This is not the start to marriage anyone envisions.\n\nLet's break down a few things you mentioned and see if we can identify some immediate steps or ways to manage the emotional weight:\n\n### 1. Acknowledging the Financial Crisis and the Blame\n\nThe moment you described\u2014when you couldn't pay bills and he was upset with you for \"not budgeting better\"\u2014is a critical, painful moment.\n\n*   **Your reality:** You have been working overtime just to cover the basics. Budgeting can only stretch so far when the income fundamental is missing.\n*   **His possible mindset (not excusing the behavior, but understanding the root):** When people feel ashamed, helpless, and depressed about their inability to provide, they sometimes lash out or deflect blame because facing the core issue (unemployment) is too painful.\n\n**It is crucial to understand that his unemployment is the primary reason for the financial strain, not your budgeting skills.** You are doing the best you can with limited resources.\n\n### 2. The Resentment\n\nResentment is a slow poison in a relationship, but it's often a sign that your own needs aren't being met.\n\n*   **How you can address this (gently):** You need to shift the focus from \"You are not trying hard enough\" (which you believe isn't true, as you believe he is trying) to **\"We need a different strategy, and I need support.\"**\n\n### 3. Immediate Next Steps (Focusing on the crisis)\n\nSince the financial situation just hit a breaking point (bills unpaid, loss of overtime), this requires immediate attention.\n\n**A. Emergency Communication:**\nYou need to have a serious, calm conversation, but first, you need to manage your own stress. When you feel ready, try framing the conversation around the *team* and the *shared crisis*, not individual failings.\n\n> \"Honey, I love you, and I know you are trying incredibly hard to find a job. But we are in a true crisis now. Losing the overtime means we have hit rock bottom financially, and it's terrifying. When you suggested I should budget better, it hurt, because I've been working myself sick to keep us afloat, and the simple truth is that we don't have enough money coming in. We need to tackle this together, starting right now.\"\n\n**B. Redefining \"Trying Hard Enough\":**\nIf he has been applying for software roles for two years with no luck, and even minimum wage jobs are falling through, it might be time to look at the job search process itself, or widen the net dramatically.\n\n*   **Is he getting feedback from interviews?** Is his resume or interview style the issue? (Sometimes, long-term depression hinders performance in interviews.)\n*   **What about non-traditional work?** Gig work, driving for services, remote customer service, trade apprenticeships, or even specialized contract work (if he is still sharp with programming). It might not be his dream job, but right now, the goal is **any income, immediately.**\n\n**C. Addressing the Depression:**\nYou both mentioned being extremely depressed. This is a major factor limiting both of your ability to cope and execute effective job searches.\n\n*   **Can you both access any resources?** Even if it's just speaking to your primary care doctor about depression screening, or looking for free/low-cost mental health resources in your area. Depression saps motivation and energy, making the job search feel insurmountable.\n\n### What do you need support with right now?\n\nThis is a huge, multi-layered problem. To help you best, could you clarify what feels like the most urgent or pressing issue you'd like to tackle first?\n\n1.  **Do you need help with practical steps** (like ideas for immediate income or resources)?\n2.  **Do you need emotional support** for dealing with the resentment and depression?\n3.  **Do you need advice on how to communicate** your feelings and the severity of the crisis to your husband without causing an explosive fight?"
