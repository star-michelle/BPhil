      "content": "School staff member looking at my chest area.. Need advice!\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the right space to ask this but I really need help, so I am a 14F (9th grade) and there is this person who works at my school, i\u2019m not really sure what she works as but i mostly see her in the deans office half of the time. When i was walking to class, she asked if i needed a bra, I told her no and that they made me uncomfortable so I don\u2019t wear them as much. She kept pressing about it and said that she looked at my breasts yesterday but didn\u2019t say anything. I was very uncomfortable at the fact that a grown woman was staring at my breasts two times in a row, She told me that she\u2019ll get me one knowing that I told her specifically that they just made me uncomfortable and I don\u2019t wear them as much. There\u2019s no dress code for this or anything, just don\u2019t wear anything inappropriate basically. I was wearing a black shirt that covered basically everything and I don\u2019t do anything to pull attention to my chest area. so, another day comes  and it\u2019s really embarrassing because she literally put bras on her computer and called me over to her computer when there\u2019s people in the office who can see and tell me to choose one that I would want, and she just kept pressing about this and pressing over and over again. It has overwhelmed me a lot. So, when the package arrives, she gives it to me infront of like two other students in the office and another person who works there, so i\u2019m feeling a bit humiliated already. She tells me to try them on, I go in the bathroom and i try it on and it is extremely tight and uncomfortable. Before that, I asked her if i had to try them on because in my head i would much rather just try them on at home in a private space. She tells me yes and that she\u2019ll love me forever if i do. I tried it on and yeah it was uncomfortable. So, I just leave the package on her desk and quickly leave because I am feeling overwhelmed and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t leave the bra on because of how tight it was so i just put it back in the bag and left. The next day, I tell her that it was uncomfortable because she had found me in the hallway and she told me to come to her office again next Thursday to pick out another few. this has been going on for weeks and like she just won\u2019t stop even after I show her my uncomfortableness. I told my mom about it the first time it happened and my mom agreed with her, my dad was the only one who found this weird. I asked my boyfriend what should I do and he told me that I should just deal with it. I mainly wear baggy clothing and I remember she called my mom and told her that if she noticed that I wasn\u2019t wearing one then boys could\u2019ve been looking at my chest too. so I have been self-conscious about my chest ever since and I don\u2019t leave anywhere without a jacket on even in hot weather. I barely know this woman , I only spoke to her a few times throughout middle school, but it was never like being THIS comfortable with each other. she won\u2019t stop and it has made me not want to come to school because I know that she\u2019s going to make a comment about my breasts, because now that\u2019s the only thing she\u2019s even talking to me about. so I hope I\u2019m not just being dramatic, but I really do need advice on how to navigate this because I\u2019m very uncomfortable with this whole entire situation and I don\u2019t know who to turn to."

      "content": "This is a deeply distressing and inappropriate situation, and I want to start by being absolutely clear: **You are not being dramatic. What this staff member is doing is inappropriate, unprofessional, and a significant boundary violation.**\n\nThe fact that she is repeatedly commenting on your body, demanding you try on clothing in public, humiliating you in front of others, and continuing to press you after you have explicitly stated your discomfort is unacceptable behavior for any school staff member.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you feel overwhelmed, self-conscious, and anxious about going to school. Your feelings are valid.\n\nHere is a step-by-step plan on how to navigate this situation, prioritize your comfort, and get this behavior to stop.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Document Everything\n\nBefore you take any formal steps, you need a record of what has happened. This documentation is crucial when reporting unprofessional conduct.\n\n*   **Create a Private Log:** Start a document (on your phone, a private notebook, or a computer file) and write down every single incident that you can remember, starting from the first time she mentioned your chest.\n*   **Include Specific Details:**\n    *   **Date and Time:** (e.g., \"Tuesday, 10/24, 10:15 AM\")\n    *   **Location:** (e.g., \"Hallway outside the Dean's office,\" \"In front of her computer\")\n    *   **Specific Quotes:** Write down exactly what she said (e.g., \"I looked at your breasts yesterday,\" \"I'll love you forever if you try it on,\" \"boys could\u2019ve been looking at your chest\").\n    *   **Witnesses:** Note who else was in the room (e.g., \"Two other students,\" \"The secretary,\" \"Ms. Jones\").\n*   **Focus on Impact:** Note how the incident made you feel (e.g., \"Humiliated,\" \"Overwhelmed,\" \"I left quickly\").\n\n## 2. Setting Boundaries\n\nIf she approaches you again before you have time to report this formally, you need a strategy to shut down the conversation quickly.\n\n*   **Avoidance:** If possible, change your route to class to avoid the Dean\u2019s office area entirely.\n*   **The \"One-Sentence Exit\":** If she stops you, do not engage in a conversation about clothing or bras. Use a brief, firm statement, and keep walking.\n    *   *Example 1:* If she asks you to come to her office: \"I\u2019m sorry, I cannot right now. I need to get to class.\"\n    *   *Example 2:* If she asks about the bra: \"I already addressed that. I have to go.\"\n    *   *Example 3:* If she tries to press you: \"That topic makes me uncomfortable. I am leaving now.\"\n\nRemember, you do not owe her an explanation or a reason for your clothing choices.\n\n## 3. Seeking Support and Reporting\n\nSince your mother initially sided with the staff member, you need to find the most supportive adult who can advocate for you.\n\n### A. Talk to Your Dad\n\nYour father was the only one who found the situation weird, which means he is concerned. This is your best starting point within your family.\n\n*   **Approach him privately.** Show him your log of events.\n*   **Explain the impact:** Tell him, \"Dad, this isn't just about a bra. She is staring at my body, humiliating me in front of other students, and making me so anxious I don't want to go to school. This is crossing a line.\"\n*   **Ask for his help to report it.** Request that he contact the school Principal or a higher administrator, not just the Dean (since this staff member works in the Dean's office).\n\n### B. Report to a School Administrator\n\nThis staff member's behavior is a serious professional conduct issue. It needs to be addressed by someone in authority.\n\n*   **Contact the Principal or Assistant Principal:** If you feel comfortable, or if your dad will do it, this is the most direct route. You need to report the staff member for:\n    1.  **Inappropriate Focus on a Minor\u2019s Body:** Staring, commenting, and repeatedly discussing your anatomy.\n    2.  **Public Humiliation/Shaming:** Making you choose items on a computer screen and handing them to you in front of others.\n    3.  **Harassment/Boundary Violation:** Pressing the issue after you clearly stated you were uncomfortable and did not want to wear a bra.\n    4.  **Victim-Blaming:** The comment about \"boys looking\" is a form of shaming and shifting responsibility away from the staff member\u2019s own inappropriate focus.\n\n*   **Contact a School Counselor (If you trust them):** A counselor\u2019s primary job is to support students. They can often act as a neutral party to escalate concerns to the administration without you having to confront the Principal yourself.\n\n### C. If You Can't Get Help at School\n\nIf the Principal or counselor does not take your concerns seriously, you and your father should contact the **School District\u2019s Central Office (Superintendent\u2019s Office)** or **Human Resources (HR)** department. Explain that a staff member is harassing you and making you feel unsafe at school, and you need this behavior to stop immediately.\n\n## 4. Addressing the Clothing and Self-Consciousness\n\nIt is awful that this woman\u2019s inappropriate focus has made you feel self-conscious and forced you to wear a jacket in hot weather.\n\n*   **Remember the Dress Code:** You stated there is no dress code about bras, only about inappropriate clothing. A black shirt that covers everything is perfectly fine.\n*   **The Problem is Her, Not You:** The problem is *her* inappropriate gaze and comments, not your body or your clothing choice. You are allowed to be comfortable in your own clothes. If any boy or adult looks at you inappropriately, that is *their* failure, not yours.\n\nPlease know that you deserve to feel safe and respected at school. This situation is serious, and taking these steps to report the behavior is the right thing to do. You are strong for reaching out and seeking help."
