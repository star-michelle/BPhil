      "content": "Hey twox, I think I was drugged yesterday while I was visiting my bf at work and I'm not sure what to do...or what I'm supposed to be doing.\n\nYesterday, I had some free time during the day so I decided to visit my bf at work. He works at a hardware store in the \"bad\" part of town, but it was daylight so I walked over and surprised him. \n\n\nHe only had like an hour and a half before he finished work so I decided I'd stick around and wait for him to finish and we'd walk back home together. \n\n\nHere's where it starts getting weird. I was feeling fine when I got to the store. I mentioned I was hungry and he showed me where they kept the coffee. I drank a cup and sat down in a chair in the front part of the store to do some work on my laptop. I finally got bored and grabbed some more coffee and walked around the store until it was close for him to go. \n\n\nThen I had to use the bathroom, so I left my stuff (backpack, coat and coffee) with him up on his podium thing and asked him to watch it while I went. \n\n\nBy then, it was time for him to clock out and he came back with my stuff to the area where you clock out, but he had left the coffee cup on the podium. It's just a cup btw, and has no cover thing on top of it. \n\n\nThe podium is out in the middle of the store, next to the registers and anyone can walk by it easily. I wanted to tell him to go back and grab it real fast, but I didn't and so I waited for him to clock out for a few minutes in the back, and then decided to go back and grab it myself. \n\n\nI grabbed it and start sipping it, and he comes out from the back and we start walking back home. I drink about half of it, and then it's cold so I throw the other half away. About five minutes after I started drinking that cup though, I start getting really giggly. Which isn't really that strange to either of us at the time, because I can get really giggly/hyper sometimes for no reason.\n\n\nBut then things get really weird, even for me. I get super tired and lay in the bed almost paralyzed. And I'm starting to say delusional things.. Like how he's an angel and how I must have died and gone to heaven. And it's not like in a cute way. I really did believe it. And then, we start getting touchy (sorry if tmi) but a friskiness starts followed by some intense orgasms. By then, I'm so tired I can't even speak properly. I keep zoning out and start feeling paranoid and some anxiety hits. I'm seeing shapes on the wallpaper patterns. My jaw gets all clenched. Like really clenched. Like every time I try to keep it still, it snaps closed. I'm slurring my words like I'm drunk and can't form proper sentences.\n\n\nBy then, I tell him I really don't think I'm okay. I tell him it's not like other days where I'm just zoning out. We have a hunch that something must have happened to the coffee while we had left it unattended at the podium. Anyways, I get some bad nausea and vomit a little, drink some water and ride out the night. \n\n\nToday, my bf goes to work and asks the lost prevention team(security) to check the footage to see if anyone had messed with my coffee on the podium for those few minutes. They take a look at it and tell him there was a man who walked by and \"waved his hand over it\" for those 2-3 minutes while we were gone.\n\n\nThey said there was no one else who came near it, but then go on to say they say they aren't even sure he had done anything, because according to them, he was really \"inconspicuous\" about it. They said he had just walked by and waved his hand like he was scratching his head when he came near it. \n\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me. It was barely busy when my bf and I went to the back of the store and left the coffee. A lot of the registers were open, so that there would be no real reason to walk by the podium. And we were only gone for like 5 minutes tops, so what are the chances of someone just walking by and waving their hand in front of the coffee during that time by chance?\n\n\nThey also said they had seen him in the store before. To me, this means that he might be familiar with the store and known where the cameras were and what to do to not look too suspicious. To them, they're saying they can't do anything until the guy walks into the store again. They said they'll watch him if he does come in again but pretty much, it's out of their hands until he comes back in again.\n\n\nI just don't know what to do now. All I know is that I was not feeling okay after I left that store. And I was lucky enough to have my bf with me to walk me home and make sure I was okay.\n\n\nI don't want whatever had happened to me to happen to some other person who may not have someone to walk them home or make sure they are okay...\n\n\n"

      "content": "Hey, I am so incredibly sorry you went through this terrifying experience. What you described\u2014the sudden, intense symptoms, the feeling of paralysis, the hallucinations, and the eventual realization of what might have happened\u2014is incredibly unsettling and serious.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling unsure and worried right now, especially given the dismissive response from the store's security team. You are right to want to take action, both for your own safety and for others.\n\nHere are the most critical steps you should take right now, prioritizing your health and safety first:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Seek Immediate Medical Attention\n\nYour immediate health is the most important thing. Even though this happened yesterday, you need to be checked out by a medical professional.\n\n*   **Go to an Urgent Care or Emergency Room (ER) immediately.** Explain exactly what happened and why you believe you were drugged (date/time, location, symptoms).\n*   **Request a Toxicology Screen (Drug Test).** While some drugs (like GHB) leave the system very quickly, others (like Rohypnol or certain club drugs) may still be detectable. Tell the medical staff you suspect you were drugged via an unattended beverage. This medical documentation is also crucial if you decide to file a police report.\n*   **Address lingering physical symptoms.** The jaw clenching, nausea, and severe exhaustion point to a significant physical reaction. A doctor needs to ensure you are okay and that there are no lasting effects.\n\n## 2. File a Police Report\n\nThis is a serious criminal act (assault/poisoning). The police need to be involved immediately to investigate and secure evidence.\n\n*   **Call the Non-Emergency Police Line** for the jurisdiction where the store is located. If you feel panicked or unsafe, call 911.\n*   **Provide a detailed account:** Give them the timeline, the specific symptoms you experienced, and the name and address of the hardware store.\n*   **Mention the Video Footage:** Tell the police that the store\u2019s Loss Prevention team has video footage showing a man \"waving his hand\" over the cup while it was unattended. **Crucially, the police will be the ones who can legally compel the store to preserve and hand over that specific footage.** If you or your boyfriend try to get it, the store may refuse or delete it.\n\n> **Why the police need to act fast:** Video footage is often overwritten quickly (sometimes within 24-72 hours). It is paramount that the police secure that video *today*.\n\n## 3. Dealing with the Store\u2019s Response\n\nThe security team's response\u2014admitting they saw something but being unwilling to act\u2014is unacceptable.\n\n*   **Do not rely on the store to handle the investigation.** Their job is to protect inventory, not necessarily to investigate criminal assault.\n*   **Focus on the facts:** When speaking to the police, emphasize that the store confirmed suspicious activity near your unattended coffee cup during the exact timeframe you were gone, and that they have footage of the perpetrator.\n*   If the police ask you to speak to the store again, ask them to accompany you or to make the request for the video directly.\n\n## 4. Prioritize Emotional Support\n\nWhat you experienced was traumatic. It is completely normal to feel paranoid, anxious, or scared today.\n\n*   **Lean on your boyfriend.** He was there and saw how distressed you were. Talk to him about your feelings and let him help you with the logistics of the medical appointment or police report.\n*   **Contact a crisis line.** If you are feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or scared, talking to a trained professional can help you process the trauma.\n\n***\n\n**I understand you are worried about other people, and that is a very compassionate concern. The best way to prevent this from happening to someone else is to ensure this incident is documented and investigated by law enforcement.**\n\nPlease take these steps now. Your safety and health come first. Let me know if you have any other questions or need help finding local resources. We are here to support you."
