I need help to safe our mariage and family.\n\nTo give you all the background this is going to be a long story, but your help will be most appreciated.\n\nWe are a married couple, 34 and 37 years old, with two beautifull children, almost 2 and 4 years old. We are from western Europe, but now live in Japan. We came here 1,5 years ago for my job, a big opportunity to create more security for our family, but my wife had to give up her job for my career. This is not the issue, we have been very happy for the last 18 months here, but it is important to realise that she made a great sacrifice for my career and financial security for us as a family. \n\nAfter a great holiday back home with a lot of hapiness came the shock. After not getting her period we became worried and a few days later found out that my wife was pregnant. Both her and mine initial reaction was panic. I will try to describe why we panicked. It is very expensife to have a child in Japan and even though we have some savings, they would be completely wiped out by having another child. Also it is very impractical to have 3 children in Japan, this country is not set up for large families. We both felt that the strain this would put on our family would be very big and that we would be able to offer our 2 children much less. Then I mean things like going to the park, sports lessons, music lessons and international school. Then there is the medical condition of my wife, she has chronic high blood pressure and the previous 2 pregnancies have been anything but easy. The whole generation of her father has died before the age of 45 (all 7 brothers and sisters!). Somehow this was only a concern for me and she did not take this into consideration. \n\nBoth our initial reaction was this is never going to work and that we need to have an abortion (we are from a liberal country and are not religious and she had an abortion 12 years ago when we were students). We discussed the situation and what to do for a few days and my decision tended to take an abortion. I made it clear to her at that point that thats how I felt and that I felt this way mainly because of her health. All the operational and financial issues can be solved, but i have a real fear that she will lose a few years of her life by having another baby. My biggest fear our whole marriage is losing her and being left alone with 2 children that we love dearly. I also told her that it was in the end her decision as it is her body and she would have to do all the work, whatever way we would go. Her decision was then to take an abortion, and to do it fast. So one week after finding out we were pregnant she had an abortion. This in itself was a very unpleasant experience. I could not be with her (not allowed by the clinic) and the staff only speaks Japanese, and she doesnt.\n\nNow we are 3 weeks further and the problems this has brought along are much bigger then I, and her, expected. Obviously she was very sad with what happened and the regret is very big for her now. I also have some regrets, for me the decision was something like 60/40. The problem is that her pain and sadness has taken the form of anger towards me and in a lesser extend to our whole family. She says that when she sees me, she is reminded of her loss and that she feels that I have taken something away from her. Also she can not really enjoy time with our 2 children. She still loves them and takes care of them, but she says the hapiness is gone. I really want to help her with her pain, but she will not open up to me emotionally. I am afraid if we can not get this fixed it will break us apart and we will all lose what we love most. \n\nI have many regrets now. I should have told her about my worries for her health and life before and we should have discussed about having a 3rd child much sooner. We have been really stupid not really talking about this. I feel now that it was better to keep this baby. It would have been hard, but the current threat to our hapiness is much bigger. \n\nI would really like your advice in how to deal with this situation. How can I help my wife, and how can I reestablish an emotional connection with her? If you have any more questions about our lifes or situation, please ask, I will be very open. This is a throwaway so I dont have anything to hide."

      "content": "This is an incredibly painful and complex situation, and I want to start by acknowledging the immense pressure, fear, and grief you are both experiencing. What you are going through is a shared trauma, even though your wife is carrying the physical and immediate emotional weight of the loss.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling scared and desperate to fix this. Please know that your feelings of regret and your fear of losing your marriage are valid. You made a difficult decision under panic, based on what you genuinely believed was best for the family\u2019s stability and, crucially, for your wife\u2019s health.\n\nThe key to navigating this is understanding the nature of your wife\u2019s current pain.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding Her Anger and Grief\n\nYour wife\u2019s anger is almost certainly **displaced grief**. It is extremely common for people experiencing deep regret after an abortion to externalize that pain. Since she co-made the decision, it can be psychologically easier to focus the blame on you (\"You took something away from me\") than to confront the immense internal guilt of having made the choice herself.\n\nShe is grieving not just the loss of the pregnancy, but also:\n\n1.  **Loss of Agency:** Even though you told her the final decision was hers, your profound fear for her health acted as a powerful influence. She may now feel that her body and her choice were dictated by your fears and the logistical constraints of your life in Japan.\n2.  **The Traumatic Experience:** The abortion itself was isolating, non-supportive, and frightening (no language, no husband). That trauma is now intertwined with the decision.\n3.  **The Sacrifice:** The underlying resentment from giving up her career for your move to Japan is likely fueling the intensity of this anger. The abortion has become the flashpoint for all accumulated sacrifices and fears.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Immediate Action \u2013 Addressing the Anger and Reestablishing Connection\n\nYour immediate goal should be to create a space where she feels heard, validated, and seen, without you defending your rationale.\n\n### 1. Stop Trying to Fix It, Start Listening\n\nWhen she expresses anger or pain, your instinct is likely to explain *why* you made the decision (her health, the finances). **You must resist this urge completely for now.** Explanations sound like justifications, and justifications invalidate her current pain.\n\nInstead, use reflective listening:\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Loss:** \"I know you are in terrible pain right now, and I am so sorry for the loss we experienced.\"\n*   **Validate the Anger:** \"I hear that you are angry with me, and I understand why you feel that way. I know I put immense pressure on you with my fears, and I regret that deeply.\"\n*   **Acknowledge the Trauma of the Day:** \"I am so sorry I couldn't be there with you in the clinic, and that you had to go through that alone and without understanding the language. That must have been terrifying.\"\n\n### 2. Take Responsibility for the Pressure, Not the Decision\n\nYou need to take responsibility for your part in the *process* without taking ownership of her emotional state.\n\n**Do not say:** \"I regret the abortion.\"\n**Say instead:** \"I regret how quickly we rushed the decision. I regret that I didn't clearly communicate my love and support for you *before* my fear took over. My fear of losing you made me push too hard, and I am profoundly sorry for the pressure I put on you.\"\n\n### 3. Focus on Shared Memory and the Future\n\nShe says seeing you reminds her of the loss. You need to re-establish yourself as her partner and the father of her living children, not just the man who influenced the abortion decision.\n\n*   **Remind her of the \"Us\":** Talk about happy memories\u2014not just from the past 18 months in Japan, but from your early marriage, your dating years, and the birth of your children. This is about reconnecting with the shared identity that predates the crisis.\n*   **Active Support:** She needs to feel the benefits of the sacrifice she made (moving to Japan). Look for ways to lighten her load that directly address her isolation and stress:\n    *   Take on 100% of the childcare during specific times so she can have uninterrupted time alone (even if she just sits quietly).\n    *   Handle all logistics regarding the children's lessons or schools.\n    *   Plan a short, supportive getaway if possible, or even just a date night where the abortion is *not* discussed unless she brings it up.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Professional Support (Crucial Step)\n\nThe emotional block is too deep for you to solve alone, especially given the language barrier and cultural isolation in Japan. You need neutral, professional help.\n\n### 1. Individual Grief Counseling for Her\n\nShe needs a safe, non-judgmental space to process the grief and anger without feeling she is damaging her marriage.\n\n*   **Immediate action:** Prioritize finding English-speaking post-abortion or grief counseling in Japan, even if it has to be done via telehealth (online) with a provider in your home country or another Western country. This is vital. Frame this to her not as \"you need fixing,\" but as: \"This was a traumatic event, and I want to find the best possible support for you to process the pain you are feeling.\"\n\n### 2. Couples Counseling\n\nOnce the immediate, raw anger subsides slightly, couples counseling will be necessary to unpack the deeper issues:\n\n*   **The Sacrifice:** Address the imbalance of her career sacrifice and how to give her back a sense of purpose and agency in Japan.\n*   **The Decision:** Work through the blame and regret in a structured environment.\n*   **Future Planning:** Re-establish communication norms so that future high-stakes decisions are handled with mutual respect and less panic.\n\n*A note on finding help in Japan: Look for international clinics or services specifically catering to the expat community (often found near large US bases or major metropolitan areas like Tokyo/Osaka/Kobe). Telehealth is often the most practical solution.*\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Long-Term Healing\n\nHealing from a traumatic decision like this takes time\u2014often months or even years. Be prepared for a marathon, not a sprint.\n\n### 1. Acknowledge Your Own Grief\n\nYou also experienced a loss, and you are carrying the heavy burden of guilt and fear. You cannot pour from an empty cup. Find your own outlet\u2014a trusted friend, a therapist, or a support group\u2014to process your 60/40 regret and your fear of losing your wife. If you don\u2019t process your own pain, you won\u2019t have the emotional capacity to support her.\n\n### 2. Focus on the Living Family\n\nYou mentioned she struggles to enjoy the two children. This is a common symptom of grief; the loss overshadows the current joy.\n\n*   **Model Happiness:** Continue to be an engaged, happy father to your two children. By showing her the joy and stability of the family you *do* have, you gently remind her of the security and love that still exists.\n*   **Shared Joy:** Initiate family activities that she usually enjoys, without pressuring her to feel happy. Simply be present and supportive.\n\nYour desire to save your marriage is powerful. By shifting your focus from \"fixing the regret\" to \"validating the pain\" and seeking professional help, you can begin the long but necessary process of rebuilding trust and emotional connection. This is a moment where your unconditional love and patience will truly be tested."
