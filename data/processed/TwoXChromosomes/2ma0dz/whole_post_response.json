Her birth was the perfect recipe for disaster. First off, my baby sister is adopted. One day, her biological mother just came into my mother's office, unceremoniously plopped a baby carrier onto a desk and asked the people there if they wanted a baby. None of them wanted the baby, but then my father walked in, took one look at the baby and decided to bring her home. \n\nEveryone in the family knew, but I suppose there's some kind of stigma in being adopted (I don't get it myself) somehow somewhere it was decided that we wouldn't tell her. -I suppose that was mistake number one or was it. I have no idea. \n\nshe was a good kid growing up. A little bit of a quick temper but nothing that really stood out. I was around 13 years old and she was 3 when my father left to work overseas (it's been 15 years since I've last seen him) we talk on the phone every few weeks but he's never been much of a talker and never been much for displays of affection.. so I guess she never had a father figure- that probably makes it factor no. 2.. \n\nthen in 6th grade something changed. Suddenly she was cutting school and drinking with older boys. 12... 12 years old... it was such a sudden shift, I didn't know what to make of it. One reason I think (I only learned this years after the fact) was her varsity volleyball coach- who got a little bit handsy. He tried to kiss her and get her to do things.. (I never knew what else happened since she just stopped talking) so this might be factor number 3.\n\nwhen she was 14 she came out as a bisexual- and our entire family is hardcore catholic... so I guess that's factor number 4\n\nSo to recap, she somehow found out she's adopted, then hits puberty, got molested by her volleyball coach, found out she was bisexual- in a family that doesn't really care for it.. poor kid never stood a chance. \n\nAfter that (sixth grade), it has been a parade of trouble. Cutting classes, talking back to the teacher. Drinking. petty theft.. in 4 years she's been to 5 different schools in two different cities. She's been cutting herself and often times I've seen her suffer from rage episodes where she just punches herself or the wall.. \n\nnow, I've been advocating counseling/rehab for the past few years now. Trouble is, my mom doesn't want the trouble, my dad doesn't believe in counseling and won't pay for it. That leaves my older sister (who is crazy in love with a guy in new york - nothing else exists outside of her quest to be united with her love) and me (currently jobless, depressed and currently in another city) \n\nI kind of get how she feels like her druggy friends are the only ones who can understand her, we're in the front page of 'family issues magazine'.. I feel like I'm the only one who cares anymore. Everybody else is treating her like she's a bad person, that she was born that way *whispers 'cause she's adopted'\n\nshe's stopped listening to me. She has tuned everybody else out and one of these days, I'm afraid she's going to do something monumentally stupid that could land her in jail or worse in the morgue. \n\nTL/DR but honestly I have no idea what I'm gonna do. no one else is taking this seriously. \n\n"

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult, painful situation, and I want to start by saying how sorry I am that you are carrying this immense burden.\n\nYou have outlined what sounds like a perfect storm of trauma and systemic failures that your sister has endured. Your analysis is insightful, empathetic, and painfully accurate. You are right: she was put in an impossible position.\n\nPlease hear this clearly: **You are not responsible for your sister\u2019s behavior, nor are you responsible for the failures of the rest of your family to step up.** The fact that you are the only one fighting for her right now, despite your own struggles with depression and joblessness, speaks volumes about your love and dedication.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you feel desperate, overwhelmed, and afraid that you are running out of time.\n\nSince you asked what you can do, and because you cannot wait for your mother or father to agree to help, we need to focus on actionable steps that you\u2014or your sister\u2014can take immediately, using resources that bypass the family dynamic.\n\n### 1. Prioritize Immediate Safety and Crisis Intervention\n\nGiven the self-harm (cutting, punching walls/herself) and the fear of a \"monumentally stupid\" action, safety is the absolute priority.\n\n*   **Crisis Hotlines:** If your sister is in immediate distress, a crisis hotline provides free, confidential support 24/7, and they are trained to deal with self-harm, rage episodes, and substance abuse. You can encourage her to use them, or you can call them yourself for advice on how to manage her rage episodes.\n    *   *(If you are in the US, the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is a critical resource. If you are elsewhere, please search for your country's national crisis line.)*\n*   **Emergency Services:** If she is actively threatening suicide, has taken an overdose, or is engaging in violence that puts her or others at risk, you must call emergency services (e.g., 911/999/112). This is often the quickest way to get her into a safe environment where professionals can intervene, even without parental consent (depending on local laws regarding minors).\n\n### 2. Focus on Trauma-Informed Resources (Bypassing Family Finances)\n\nYour sister\u2019s behavior is a direct result of trauma (the abuse, the adoption secret, the family rejection). She needs specialized help. Since your parents won't fund private therapy, look for subsidized or free options:\n\n*   **Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs):** These centers are often government-funded and provide sliding-scale or free mental health services, often including substance abuse treatment and crisis stabilization. They do not require insurance or high upfront fees. Search for \"Community Mental Health Services [Your City/Region].\"\n*   **School Resources:** If she is still enrolled in a school (even if she\u2019s cutting classes), the school counselor or social worker is a mandatory reporter and can often facilitate contact with outside services, sometimes even transporting the student to appointments. They may also have resources specifically for students dealing with sexual abuse.\n*   **LGBTQ+ Youth Centers:** Given the family conflict over her bisexuality, finding a center that provides support for queer youth can offer her a sense of belonging and validation that she is missing at home. These centers often run free support groups and counseling specifically for trauma and family rejection.\n*   **Victim Advocacy Services:** The abuse by the coach is a crime. Local non-profits that support survivors of sexual assault often provide free, long-term counseling, legal advocacy, and safe spaces. They can also help your sister process the trauma without requiring her to involve the police immediately if she is not ready.\n\n### 3. Address the Legal/Reporting Element (The Coach)\n\nThe molestation is a critical issue that fuels her self-destructive behavior. If your sister is still a minor (under 18), mandatory reporting laws may apply.\n\n*   **Consult a Child Protective Services (CPS) equivalent** in your region. You can call them anonymously for advice. They can investigate the coach and, if necessary, intervene in the home environment, which might force your mother to take action.\n*   **Let your sister lead.** She may not be ready to report the coach. Pressure to report can be retraumatizing. However, knowing that free counseling exists through sexual assault resource centers might be a powerful first step.\n\n### 4. How to Talk to Her Now That She\u2019s Tuned You Out\n\nIt is devastating when someone you love stops listening, but often, the tuning out happens because they feel judged or overwhelmed by the attempts to \"fix\" them.\n\n*   **Validate, Don't Analyze:** Stop trying to convince her to go to rehab or counseling right now. Instead, validate her pain. You understand her history better than anyone. Instead of saying, \"You need therapy because of the coach,\" try: \"I know how much pain you are in right now, and I know why. It makes perfect sense that you feel this way. I love you, and I am here.\"\n*   **Acknowledge the Family Dysfunction:** You are right\u2014your family is a mess. You can bond with her over this shared truth. \"Our family is struggling, and I know how isolating that feels. It\u2019s not your fault.\"\n*   **Focus on Small, Immediate Needs:** Instead of demanding she change her life, ask her what she needs *today*. A ride? Food? A distraction? Sometimes, connecting over a small, concrete act of kindness can rebuild trust.\n*   **Use the \"Druggy Friends\" as a Clue:** Her friends provide acceptance and escape. Your goal isn't to replace them, but to offer a safer alternative that also provides acceptance.\n\n### 5. You Must Care for Yourself\n\nYou are jobless, depressed, and living in another city, yet you are trying to be the sole lifeline for someone drowning. This is a recipe for burnout.\n\nYou cannot effectively help your sister if your own cup is empty.\n\n*   **Seek Support for Yourself:** You need to prioritize your own mental health (depression) and job search. Look for free/low-cost counseling for yourself, perhaps through your city's health department or a local university's psychology program.\n*   **Set Boundaries with the Family:** You need to conserve your energy. Stop trying to convince your parents. They have made their choices. Focus your energy only on your sister and your own recovery.\n*   **Connect with Support Groups:** Look for NAMI (National Alliance on Mental Illness) family support groups or groups for siblings of addicts. These groups are vital for helping you manage the crisis without taking responsibility for the outcome.\n\nYou are a phenomenal sibling, and you are doing everything right by caring so deeply. Please, use the resources available to you so that you don't break under the weight of this trauma."
