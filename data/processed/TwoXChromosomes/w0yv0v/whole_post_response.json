      "content": "Sexual Harassment at Dinner. I'm so frustrated.\n\nI went out to have dinner tonight with my little sister. Our table was near a window with me facing the window and thankfully her back towards the window. Our entr\u00e9es arrived and we began eating. Shortly after, I saw a man in the window facing towards me. I thought it was strange that there was a man just standing in front of the window but I ignored it at first because maybe he was just waiting for someone. I take a few bites of my food and look back up at the window and the man is standing up and jerking off, taking his thing in and out of\nhis pants. I didn't want to draw attention to it, especially with my little sister (14) eating with me. I tried my best to ignore it but I came home feeling so depressed, angry and frustrated. I feel like I should have told someone. Is this more than sexual harassment?\n\nThank you for listening"

      "content": "I am so incredibly sorry that this happened to you. That is a horrifying, disturbing, and deeply violating experience, and it is completely understandable why you feel depressed, angry, and frustrated. Please know that your feelings are 100% valid.\n\nFirst and foremost, thank you for sharing this difficult experience.\n\n### Addressing Your Feelings and Actions\n\nPlease do not feel guilty for the way you reacted. In situations of shock and violation, the primary instinct is often to protect yourself and those you are with. Your priority was clearly protecting your little sister from an awful situation. By trying to ignore the man, you were attempting to minimize the trauma for your sister and keep both of you safe. That was a completely rational and understandable reaction.\n\n### Is This More Than Sexual Harassment?\n\nYes. While this act is absolutely a form of sexual harassment\u2014unwanted sexual conduct that creates a hostile environment\u2014legally, it is classified as a serious crime.\n\nThe man\u2019s actions of exposing himself and performing a sexual act in public view are generally classified as **Indecent Exposure** or **Public Indecency**. These are serious misdemeanors or felonies, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific circumstances (such as performing the act toward a minor, though in this case, he was facing you).\n\nIt is not just a matter of poor behavior; it is a violation of law and a traumatic act.\n\n### What You Can Do Now\n\nYou have every right to feel violated, and you deserve to feel safe. If you choose to take action, there are a few options available to you, and you can choose to pursue any or none of them:\n\n#### 1. Reporting to the Police\n\nBecause this is a crime (Indecent Exposure), you can file a police report. Even if time has passed, the police can take a statement, and this information may be helpful if this man is a known offender in the area or if the restaurant has security cameras that captured him.\n\nIf you choose to file a report, try to recall:\n\n*   The exact time and date this happened.\n*   A physical description of the man (height, clothing, hair color, approximate age).\n*   Whether he walked away or ran, and in what direction.\n\n#### 2. Contacting the Restaurant\n\nYou can contact the restaurant manager (or even the general manager of the chain) to inform them of what happened.\n\n*   This alerts them to a security issue that occurred on their property.\n*   They may have exterior security cameras that could have captured the man.\n*   They may be able to offer assurance that they will increase security patrols around the windows.\n\n#### 3. Seeking Emotional Support\n\nExperiences like this can cause long-term distress, anxiety, and distrust. It is highly recommended that you talk through these feelings with a professional or a trusted resource.\n\n*   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** They operate a national hotline for victims of sexual assault and harassment. They can provide confidential support and resources in your area.\n    *   **1-800-656-HOPE**\n\n***\n\nThank you again for reaching out and sharing this difficult story. You did nothing wrong, and your reaction was completely valid.\n\nGiven how angry and frustrated you feel, what kind of support are you looking for right now? Are you interested in exploring reporting options, or would you like to find resources for emotional support?"
