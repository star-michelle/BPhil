How do I get over it?\n\nI really need help I don't know what to do with myself ):\n\n\nWe moved in 7 months ago and I found out last week that he had been cheating on me with a girl from work for the past few weeks. I kicked him out of the house and told him I don't want to see him again. He has been lying to both of us about it, I don't even know if he was ever going to tell me.\n\n\nAnyway I'm heartbroken and single for the first time ever. How do I start to get over it? I've never had to get over someone before. I know he is a horrible coward and I deserve better but I miss him. It's such a frustrating feeling.\n\n\nAny tips would be appreciated <3"

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult, painful situation, and I am so sorry you are going through this. Please know that what you are feeling\u2014the shock, the heartbreak, the confusion, and even the missing of him\u2014is completely normal and valid.\n\nWhat you did\u2014kicking him out immediately and setting that boundary\u2014was an act of incredible strength and self-respect, especially when you are hurting so much. That was a huge step, and you should be proud of yourself for protecting yourself.\n\nYou are asking how to start the process of getting over it, and that\u2019s a great question. Grieving a relationship is a process, not a single event, and it takes time. Since this is your first time navigating a breakup and betrayal, let's break down some steps you can take to manage the immediate pain and start moving forward.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Immediate Self-Care and Stabilizing (The First Few Weeks)\n\nThe goal right now is just to survive each day and treat yourself with absolute kindness.\n\n### 1. **Establish Strict No Contact (Crucial)**\nYou\u2019ve already kicked him out, which is the hardest part. Now, you need to maintain a complete block on communication.\n\n*   **Block him everywhere:** Phone, social media, email. You need a clean break to allow your emotional wounds to start healing.\n*   **Why this is important:** Every time you see his name or hear from him, it re-traumatizes you and resets the healing clock. You need space to process *your* feelings, not his attempts to justify himself.\n\n### 2. **Allow Yourself to Grieve**\nYou aren't just losing a boyfriend; you are losing a future you planned, a home life you built, and the trust you had. This is a massive loss.\n\n*   **Don't fight the feelings:** If you need to cry, cry. If you need to scream into a pillow, do it. Schedule time (maybe 30 minutes a day) to intentionally feel sad, and then try to redirect your energy afterward.\n*   **The \"Missing Him\" vs. \"Missing the Idea\":** It is completely frustrating to miss a \"horrible coward,\" but you are likely missing the **comfort, routine, and security** of the 8-year relationship, and the **person you thought he was**. Try to remind yourself that the person you miss doesn't actually exist\u2014the real person is the one who lied to you for weeks.\n\n### 3. **Rely on Your Support System**\nYou do not have to go through this alone.\n\n*   **Reach out:** Call trusted friends or family members. Tell them exactly what you need: someone to listen, someone to watch a movie with, or someone to just sit silently next to you.\n*   **Be honest:** It's okay to say, \"I'm heartbroken and I need distraction.\" Let them help you.\n\n### 4. **Maintain Basic Necessities**\nWhen you\u2019re heartbroken, it\u2019s easy to forget to eat or sleep.\n\n*   **Focus on the basics:** Try to eat small, regular meals (even if you don't feel hungry), drink water, and attempt to maintain a sleep schedule. Healing requires physical energy.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Starting to Rebuild (The Next Few Months)\n\nAs the initial shock fades, you can start focusing on rebuilding your sense of self and independence.\n\n### 5. **Reclaim Your Space**\nSince you are still in the house you shared, it's vital to make it feel like *yours* again, not *ours*.\n\n*   **Physical changes:** Change the sheets, move the furniture, buy some new art, or even just deep-clean the kitchen. Eliminate or put away items that are constant reminders of him. This helps your environment feel safe and new.\n\n### 6. **Redefine Your Identity**\nYou mentioned you are \"single for the first time ever.\" This is a huge, scary, but also exciting opportunity.\n\n*   **Make a list of \"Me Only\" activities:** What hobbies or interests did you put on hold while you were in the relationship? Start doing them.\n    *   *Example:* If you wanted to try a pottery class, sign up. If you wanted to read more, go to the library.\n*   **Focus on your career/education:** Throwing yourself into something productive helps redirect the energy that would otherwise be spent worrying about him.\n\n### 7. **Journaling and Processing the Betrayal**\nWriting can be incredibly therapeutic, especially when dealing with betrayal and lies.\n\n*   **Write down the facts:** Anytime you start romanticizing the relationship or missing him, write down the facts of the betrayal: *He lied for weeks. He was a coward. He put his needs above my well-being.* This serves as a reality check.\n*   **Process the \"Why\":** You don't need to understand *why* he did it, but you need to process the *impact* it had on you. Write about how it made you feel (angry, cheapened, confused). Get the poison out onto the page.\n\n### 8. **Be Patient with Yourself**\nThere is no timeline for getting over 8 years. You will have good days where you feel strong and bad days where you feel like you're back at square one.\n\n*   **Treat setbacks gently:** If you cry over a memory, that is okay. It doesn't mean you haven't made progress; it means you are human. Acknowledge the feeling and keep moving forward.\n\nYou have already taken the hardest step. You are brave, you deserve better, and you have the strength to get through this. Take it minute by minute, hour by hour, and day by day. You will get to the other side of this heartbreak. \u2764\ufe0f"
