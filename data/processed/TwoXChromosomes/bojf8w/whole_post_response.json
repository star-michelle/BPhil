      "content": "I don't know if I should leave my terminally ill husband.\n\nI'll try to be as detailed as possible/try to explain as best as I can but I'm forgetful and might have to edit to elaborate.\n\nI'm in an abusive relationship; my husband is physically, sexually, mentally and financially abusive. I'm 19 years old and my husband is 30. we met and started dating when I was underage (I was 14) but I was isolated and alone, none of my family cared about me so I didn't have anyone to tell me that maybe this relationship was wrong. We got married the week I turned 18, and this January, we moved up north, close to the border of Canada, in the middle of nowhere. And I mean NOWHERE, the nearest store is 15 miles away, the hospital is even further and I'm wheelchair bound and can't drive.\n\nso I'm trapped and isolated, and I have a 3 year old son, and an 8 month old baby (both are his kids). and this week, I found out that I'm pregnant. so I'm feeling even more trapped, especially because I don't work and he makes all the money. even if I could physically leave, I have kids, I'm pregnant, I'm disabled and I didn't graduate high school so my job choices are slim to none.\n\nfor more context, I'm disabled because, over the last couple of years, he has repeatedly dislocated my hips. And, the last time he did it, when we moved, he kept me from getting medical treatment, so the bone started dying. there's no way to reverse it, just slow it down and help deal with the pain, which I can't do either because he won't let me go to physical therapy.\n\nalso, I can't go on birth control. the pill has really adverse and severe side effects, and Im very forgetful so I miss days, which negates the whole point of taking it. and this pregnancy actually happened while I was on the IUD, so even long term birth control doesn't work. I dont know why. and because I can't go on birth control, I have had multiple pregnancies, one after the other, but most have ended in miscarriage because of all the stress and physical abuse.\n\nBUT, the main reason leaving has been an option recently is because in March, my husband was diagnosed with something terminal and was told that he probably had 2 years left. 5 maybe; a 20% chance he'd make it to five years. and I dont know if I should just stay with him for the rest of his life, or if I should just leave him. it would seem cruel to leave him while he's sick, but he's not himself lately because of the medicine he takes. I managed to get a job babysitting my neighbors kids (its only 20 dollars a day but I can take my kids with me) without him noticing because he's either at work or asleep. that never would have happened before; he's always maintained a firm grip on my freedom and finances.\n\nso, like I said. I don't know if I should leave while I can or just wait it out. it seems cruel to leave. but there's always a possibility he'll make it to 5 or even 10 years, and if he continues to be as abusive as he always is (or even worse), I'll probably die from the physical abuse (he's actually nearly killed me multiple times and my throat is permanently damaged because of it).\n\nedit: the one thing I forgot to mention was that I have reported him multiple times to the police and to doctors. every time, he managed to get the police to believe him and not me, even when I was a minor. he'd purposefully hurt me in ways that looked like self injury because I have a history of depression and suicidal tendencies. he even once had me involuntarily committed to a mental hospital after I tried to leave him; he had told the doctors that I was suffering from postpartum psychosis (this was after I had my 8 month old) and they believed him because he works in the medical field.\n\nedit 2: this is a crosspost r/relationship_advice"

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult and urgent situation. Please know that what you are going through is horrific, and your feelings of being trapped, isolated, and overwhelmed are completely valid.\n\nI want to be absolutely clear: **Your life is in danger. You and your children deserve to be safe.**\n\nBefore we address the complexity of your husband\u2019s illness, the most critical step is connecting you with professional, specialized support. You are in a life-threatening situation, and the barriers you face\u2014isolation, disability, financial dependence, and his manipulation of authorities\u2014are exactly what trained domestic violence advocates are equipped to handle.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate Safety Resources\n\n**Do not try to handle this alone.** Please contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline immediately, using a method you can ensure is private (perhaps while you are babysitting or when he is asleep/at work).\n\n*   **National Domestic Violence Hotline:**\n    *   **Call:** 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)\n    *   **Text:** \"START\" to 88788\n    *   **Chat:** TheHotline.org (This may be the safest option if you cannot speak freely)\n\n**They can help you create an emergency safety plan tailored to your specific situation (disability, pregnancy, isolation, lack of resources).**\n\n---\n\n## 2. Addressing the Dilemma: Leaving While He Is Ill\n\nYou are facing a profound moral conflict, but it is essential to reframe this situation:\n\n### Abuse Does Not Stop Because of Illness\n\nYour husband's terminal diagnosis does not absolve him of his abusive behavior, nor does it negate the severe danger he poses to you and your children. He has physically disabled you, permanently damaged your throat, and nearly killed you multiple times.\n\n**Leaving him is not cruel; it is necessary for survival.**\n\n### The Risk of Waiting It Out\n\nYou mentioned two critical points about waiting:\n\n1.  **He might live 5 or 10 years:** If he lives that long, that is 5 to 10 more years of escalating violence, potential miscarriages, and guaranteed abuse that could result in your death.\n2.  **The medicine is changing him:** While the medication may be temporarily distracting him (creating your window of opportunity), abusers often escalate violence as they lose control or face stress (like a terminal diagnosis). Even if he is \"not himself,\" the abuse is still occurring, and his physical actions have already caused you life-altering injuries.\n\n**The window of opportunity you have now\u2014where he is distracted enough for you to earn money and communicate privately\u2014is a temporary gift. You must use it, because if his health deteriorates further, he may become more volatile, or you may lose the small freedom you have.**\n\n---\n\n## 3. Addressing Your Barriers and Traps\n\nYour situation is complex, but please understand that every single barrier you listed is something that domestic violence organizations and advocates have procedures for addressing:\n\n| Your Barrier | How Advocates Can Help |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Isolation and Location (Middle of Nowhere)** | Advocates specialize in remote safety planning. They can coordinate with shelters and law enforcement (if necessary and safe) to arrange safe transportation out of isolated areas. |\n| **Disability (Wheelchair-Bound)** | Shelters and support services are legally required to provide accommodations for people with disabilities (ADA). Advocates will help you find a safe shelter that can meet your medical and mobility needs, including access to physical therapy and medical care that he has denied you. |\n| **Financial Dependence & Lack of Diploma** | Advocates can connect you immediately to emergency financial aid, housing assistance, WIC (for food/formula), and programs that offer job training or help completing a GED/high school equivalency. |\n| **Children and Pregnancy** | Shelters accept children. Advocates will prioritize getting you prenatal care and ensuring your children are safe and seen by medical professionals. |\n| **Past Failures (Police/Medical Manipulation)** | Advocates understand \"coercive control\" and how abusers who work in the medical field can manipulate systems. They can provide legal advocacy to help you counter his claims and ensure authorities take your abuse seriously this time. |\n| **Birth Control Issues** | Medical professionals who are independent of your husband can thoroughly investigate why your birth control is failing and discuss options that are safe for you. This is a crucial health concern that needs immediate attention once you are safe. |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Immediate, Private Steps You Can Take\n\nSince you have a small window of privacy and income, use it strategically:\n\n1.  **Contact the Hotline Privately:** Use the time you are babysitting or while he is asleep/at work to call, text, or chat with the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Do not use a shared computer or phone if he monitors it. If you have to, use the neighbor\u2019s phone while babysitting.\n2.  **Save the $20:** Every dollar you earn from the babysitting job should be saved and hidden. This money is for emergency transportation, burner phones, or communication costs only. Do not spend it on anything he might notice.\n3.  **Gather Critical Documents (If Safe):** If you can do this without him noticing, start gathering:\n    *   Your ID, passport, or birth certificate (and your children's).\n    *   Your social security card (and your children's).\n    *   Any documentation related to his diagnosis or medication.\n    *   Any evidence of his financial control (bank statements, bills).\n4.  **Document Everything Now:** While he is distracted, quietly document specific incidents of abuse (dates, what happened, what injury you sustained, how he framed it to police/doctors). This documentation is critical for legal aid and restraining orders once you leave. Keep this log hidden outside the house if possible (e.g., email it to yourself from a library computer, or write it down and hide it at the neighbor's house).\n\n**Your priority is leaving safely, while you still have the physical and mental ability to do so, and before he notices your small window of freedom.** Please reach out to the resources above. Your safety\u2014and the safety of your children\u2014is paramount."
