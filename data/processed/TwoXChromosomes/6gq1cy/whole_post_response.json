I've attempted another relationship since then but it just doesn't compare to what I had. I thought I would marry this ex. This is the second time in my life, over the course of 11 years I thought I would marry someone. I'm losing hope. I don't think I'll ever find someone. Please help, I don't have any hope and it hurts..."

      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to talk about this, and I want to acknowledge how painful and overwhelming this must feel right now.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are struggling to move on, especially since you had such a deep connection and saw a future with your ex. Eight or nine months is still a relatively short time when you are grieving the loss of a relationship that meant so much to you.\n\nThe feelings of hopelessness and the fear that you\u2019ll never find someone else are very common when dealing with significant heartbreak, especially after investing so much emotionally.\n\nI hear a few key things that are causing you distress:\n\n1.  **You are still deeply attached to your ex** and the relationship you lost.\n2.  **Recent attempts at new relationships didn't work out** and only highlighted what you feel you are missing.\n3.  **You are losing hope** because this is the second time in 11 years you\u2019ve felt this level of commitment and loss.\n\nTo help me understand your situation better and offer the most relevant support, could you clarify a few things?\n\n**1. Regarding the break-up:**\nWhat kind of contact, if any, do you currently have with your ex? (e.g., Are you still talking, seeing them, or are you in strict No Contact?)\n\n**2. Regarding the attempt at a new relationship:**\nDid you feel ready to date when you started that new relationship, or were you hoping it might distract you from the pain of the breakup?\n\n**3. Regarding your support system:**\nAre there friends, family, or activities you are currently leaning on to help you through the day-to-day pain?\n\nWe can start exploring some steps to help you regain hope and begin the process of moving forward once I have a little more context. Please take your time responding, and remember, your feelings are valid."
