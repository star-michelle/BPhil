      "content": "Ex BF family sues me for imaginary child they think I have\n\nI originally posted this on r/legaladvice bUt someone suggested I post it here for more woman perspective. If anybody has any tips or help on what to do I would really appreciate it. \n\nEdited: I know I wasn\u2019t the best partner ever but this is insane how far they\u2019re going to ruin my life. I don\u2019t get why there are people going this far to cause harm. \nIt was because of this past relationship that I to seek out therapy, and this is making so fearful for my future and giving me crippling anxiety. \n\n\nThrow-away account obviously.\n\nI escaped an abusive toxic relationship over a year ago, broken hearted. A couple months ago my ex\u2019s brother calls me and says that my ex died and he want me to know how much he hated me and that I am not welcome to the funeral and that everyone there hates me. Completely uncalled for but still hurt a lot. Now yesterday I get served paperwork\u2019s for a lawsuit my Ex\u2019s mother filed for a child she thinks I had that i never did. I can\u2019t even get pregnant. I don\u2019t even think my ex is deceased, I think they\u2019re going out of their way to torment me. I don\u2019t know what to do. They think I carried a child when we broke up and now sued me for custody I\u2019ve been freaking out. I don\u2019t want more trouble. And these are insane white rich people that have hired two attorneys for this lawsuit. I built up the courage to try and call the attorney to explain that this must be a mistake because I don\u2019t have a child and I\u2019ve never been pregnant. All they did was yell at me and not let me speak telling me how bad I\u2019m going to have for not complying. When I managed to get a word in saying I don\u2019t have a kid they insisted I put it for adoption and how screwed I am for doing this. I don\u2019t know what to do I don\u2019t have much funds to hire a lawyer and I\u2019m completely ignorant of the process. If anybody has any tips it would mean the world to me. Sorry for making this half a venting too. Thank you."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly stressful, frightening, and deeply unfair. I am so sorry you are going through this, especially after escaping an abusive relationship and working on your healing. It is completely understandable that this is causing you crippling anxiety\u2014this situation is truly shocking and designed to torment you.\n\nYou are being targeted by people who are acting maliciously and perhaps delusionally. **The most important thing to remember right now is that you have rights, and you must protect yourself legally.**\n\nHere is a breakdown of steps and advice, focusing on the legal necessity and your emotional well-being.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate Legal Action is Essential\n\n**Do not try to handle this by calling the opposing attorneys again.** Their goal is to intimidate you and gather information they can twist. They have no incentive to believe you. You must respond formally to the lawsuit.\n\n### A. You MUST Respond to the Lawsuit\n\nWhen you are served with paperwork, it starts a legal clock. If you fail to respond within the required timeframe (usually 20 to 30 days, depending on your jurisdiction and the type of document), the opposing party can win by default, meaning the court accepts their claims as true simply because you didn't show up to defend yourself.\n\n**Action Step:**\n*   **Identify the Deadline:** Look at the documents you were served (the Summons and Complaint). It will state how many days you have to file a formal \"Answer\" or \"Response\" with the court. **This is your most urgent priority.**\n*   **Identify the Court and Case Number:** Note the court (e.g., Superior Court of X County) and the case number.\n\n### B. You Need Legal Representation (Even Limited)\n\nI understand you mentioned limited funds. However, ignoring a lawsuit\u2014especially one involving custody\u2014is the most expensive mistake you can make.\n\n**Action Steps for Finding Affordable Help:**\n\n1.  **Legal Aid/Pro Bono Services:**\n    *   Contact your local **Legal Aid Society** or **Legal Services** organization. Because this case involves family law (custody) and you have low income, you may qualify for free assistance.\n    *   Search for **Women's Legal Centers** or organizations that specialize in helping survivors of domestic abuse, as they often have legal resources.\n\n2.  **Limited Scope Representation (Unbundling):**\n    *   If you cannot afford full representation, look for attorneys who offer \"unbundled\" services. This means they might charge a flat fee just to draft your formal Answer to the Complaint, or advise you on the next steps, or attend one critical hearing. This is much cheaper than hiring a lawyer for the whole case.\n\n3.  **Bar Association Referral:**\n    *   Contact your State or County Bar Association. They often have a referral service where you can get a brief, low-cost (or sometimes free) consultation with an attorney.\n\n### C. The Content of Your Response\n\nWhen you file your Answer, you will formally deny all their claims.\n\n*   **Deny the Existence of the Child:** You will unequivocally state that you did not give birth to a child, were never pregnant, and therefore cannot be sued for custody or support.\n*   **Lack of Jurisdiction/Standing:** Your lawyer will likely argue that the court lacks jurisdiction over a non-existent child, and the grandmother lacks \"standing\" (the legal right) to sue for custody of a child that does not exist.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Evidence and Documentation\n\nYou mentioned you cannot get pregnant. This is a critical piece of information.\n\n**Action Steps:**\n\n*   **Medical Records:** Gather any medical records, tests, or doctor's statements that confirm your inability to conceive or that you have never been pregnant. This may be the fastest way to prove their lawsuit is frivolous.\n*   **Communication Log:** Document everything:\n    *   The date you were served the papers.\n    *   The date and content of the phone call from the ex's brother (mentioning the death).\n    *   The date and content of your phone call with the opposing attorneys (they yelled at you).\n*   **Preserve the Paperwork:** Keep the original Summons and Complaint in a safe, secure place. Do not write on them.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Addressing the Harassment and Emotional Impact\n\nIt is highly likely that they are engaging in this lawsuit not because they genuinely believe you have a child, but because they know it is the maximum way to cause you distress, financial strain, and legal trouble. This is an extension of the abuse and toxicity you escaped.\n\n### A. Safety and Boundaries\n\n*   **Block All Contact:** Do not communicate with the ex-boyfriend, his brother, or his mother. All contact must go through the court or your attorney.\n*   **Cease Communication with Opposing Counsel:** As mentioned, do not call them again. They are not your friends and they are actively working against you.\n\n### B. Mental Health Support\n\nYou mentioned this is causing crippling anxiety. Please prioritize your mental health:\n\n*   **Lean on Your Therapist:** If you are still seeing a therapist, bring this situation up immediately. They can help you manage the anxiety and trauma response this harassment is triggering.\n*   **Crisis Resources:** If the anxiety becomes overwhelming, please use a crisis hotline. You can reach the **National Domestic Violence Hotline** at 800-799-7233 (they often deal with post-separation abuse and harassment).\n\n### C. Is the Ex Really Deceased?\n\nYou are right to be suspicious. Often, abusers and their families will use lies about death or serious illness to lure the victim back into contact or guilt them.\n\n*   **Do Not Investigate Yourself:** Do not try to confirm if he is alive or dead. Any contact is a risk.\n*   **If the issue of his death becomes relevant in court (e.g., if he is named as the father), your attorney can handle the formal investigation (e.g., requesting a death certificate).** For now, assume they are lying and focus only on the legal claim against you.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Find a Lawyer IMMEDIATELY.** Contact Legal Aid or a local Bar Association referral service today to discuss your limited funds and urgent deadline.\n2.  **DO NOT MISS THE DEADLINE.** You must file a formal Answer to the court denying all claims.\n3.  **Gather Medical Evidence** that proves you could not have carried a child.\n4.  **Prioritize Your Mental Health** and use your support system.\n\nYou are strong for escaping that relationship, and you are strong enough to deal with this malicious attack. This is a tactic of control and harassment, not a genuine legal issue based on reality. Focus on the legal process, and remember that the truth (that the child does not exist) is on your side."
