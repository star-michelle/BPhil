Please help.\n\nHi all, \n\nIn short, because of some very stupid decisions made during sex between my boyfriend and me, there is a chance I am pregnant (I'm 18 years old). Please, please don't bash me for this because I already feel terrible. My boyfriend and I have been together 5 months and usually have sex with condoms (even so, he's not allowed to come inside me). Sometimes, though, in the heat of the moment we'll have sex without condoms... I've had to take Plan B about 4 times in 3 months! Usually this happens because we'll be messing around and he slowly puts it inside of me without a condom but the consent is murky, and this past time I'm not sure I've consented to him putting it in me without a condom. \n\nBut now my period is 2 weeks late and I am incredibly angry at both him and myself... angry at him for not putting on condoms and angry at myself for allowing it to happen and not saying \"no\". I've already taken 3 pregnancy tests that all said not pregnant but I'm still terrified because I took those only a few days after possible conceptions. \n\nI'm even angrier because while he's a sweet, respectful guy, if I do have to get an abortion there's a chance he'll be states away and not physically be there for me. He'll be with his family in New York while I'm stuck with the physical pain and worry in a southern state that hates abortions and girls who get abortions. I don't have anyone to turn to if I need a ride or a stay after getting a medication abortion. My boyfriend is willing to drive down a few cities to help me out as long as he's in the same state but I'm angry at him for not willing to help me out if he's in a different state. I'm angry because it's mostly his fault (I say mostly because I didn't explicitly tell him NO) for not using a condom this last time, and for not going out of his way to buy a plane ticket and find a way to get to me if I do end up having an abortion. \n\nPlease, please help me with some advice... do I stay with my boyfriend? What do I do about the potential abortion? Is he terrible for not willing to leave states if I get an abortion or am I expecting too much? Thank you.\n\n"

      "content": "This sounds like an incredibly stressful and overwhelming situation, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you are feeling scared, angry, and confused right now. Please know that you are in a safe space here, and there is absolutely no judgment. We can take this step by step.\n\nIt\u2019s important to address the most immediate concerns first: your health and the uncertainty about your pregnancy status.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate Steps: Confirmation and Health\n\nYou mentioned your period is two weeks late and you\u2019ve taken tests a few days after conception, which might have been too early for accurate results.\n\n**What you need to do now is confirm if you are pregnant.**\n\n*   **When to Test:** A home pregnancy test is typically accurate if taken **at least one week** after your missed period, or 21 days after the unprotected sex. Since you are two weeks late, a test taken now should be reliable.\n*   **Take Another Test:** Please go out and buy a reliable home pregnancy test today and follow the instructions carefully.\n*   **Seek Medical Confirmation:** The most definitive way to know is through a blood test at a clinic.\n\n**Where to Get Help and Support (Confidential and Low-Cost):**\n\n*   **Planned Parenthood or Local Women's Health Clinics:** These clinics can provide accurate pregnancy tests, ultrasounds, and non-judgmental counseling about all your options (parenting, adoption, or abortion). They can also discuss reliable birth control methods moving forward.\n*   **Find a Clinic:** You can use the Planned Parenthood website or search for \"women's health clinic near me\" to find a reputable, non-religious facility.\n\n**The most crucial thing right now is knowing for sure.** Once you have a definitive answer, you can make informed decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Addressing Your Relationship and Consent Concerns\n\nIt is completely valid that you are angry at both your boyfriend and yourself, but it sounds like you are wrestling with some serious issues regarding consent and responsibility in your sexual relationship.\n\n### Regarding Consent and Responsibility\n\nYou mentioned:\n*   \"Sometimes, though, in the heat of the moment we'll have sex without condoms...\"\n*   \"...he slowly puts it inside of me without a condom but the consent is murky...\"\n*   \"...this past time I'm not sure I've consented to him putting it in me without a condom.\"\n*   \"I\u2019m angry at him for not putting on condoms and angry at myself for allowing it to happen and not saying 'no'.\"\n\n**Let's be absolutely clear about consent:**\n\n*   **Consent must be enthusiastic, continuous, and clearly given for every sexual act.** If you are not sure you consented, that means consent was not present.\n*   **The responsibility for using a condom rests with both partners, but deliberately removing or not using a condom when one was agreed upon, or when a partner is unsure, is a serious violation of trust and consent.** What you are describing, where he \"slowly puts it inside of me without a condom but the consent is murky,\" is highly concerning behavior.\n*   **You are never responsible for someone else's failure to use protection or respect your boundaries.** Saying \"no\" or not saying \"no\" does not change the fact that he initiated a sexual act that was against your stated boundaries (using a condom, not coming inside you) without clear, enthusiastic consent.\n\nThis is not just about contraception; this is about **respect and safety** in your relationship. A sweet and respectful guy does not violate boundaries or put his partner's health and future at risk through murky consent.\n\n### Should You Stay with Your Boyfriend?\n\nThis is a decision only you can make, but based on what you\u2019ve shared, there are serious red flags you need to consider carefully:\n\n*   **Boundary Violation:** He repeatedly ignores your boundary about using condoms and coming inside you, forcing you to rely on Plan B frequently (which is hard on your body and expensive).\n*   **Murky Consent:** His actions leading to sex without a condom seem to cross the line of genuine consent.\n*   **Lack of Shared Responsibility in Crisis:** His unwillingness to fully commit to supporting you physically if you need an abortion, especially considering his role in the situation, shows a lack of maturity and commitment.\n\n**Advice:** It might be helpful to take a step back and evaluate this relationship based on how he treats you when things are *not* easy. Does he prioritize your safety and well-being? A good partner would never intentionally put you in a position where you have to take Plan B four times in three months or risk an unwanted pregnancy.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Addressing the Abortion Scenario and His Support\n\nIf you are pregnant and decide on an abortion, your feelings about his lack of commitment are completely justified.\n\n**Is he terrible for not willing to leave states? Am I expecting too much?**\n\nYou are not expecting too much. You are expecting him to take responsibility for the potential consequences of his actions.\n\n*   **The Reality of Support:** Getting an abortion (medication or surgical) requires physical recovery and emotional support. In a state that is hostile to abortion, having a trusted person there for transport, comfort, and care is essential.\n*   **His Role:** He participated in the actions that led to this crisis. His willingness to help only if it is convenient for him (i.e., when he is already in the same state) shows that his priorities are his convenience and his family plans, not your immediate, critical needs.\n*   **The Standard of a Partner:** A supportive partner, especially one who contributed to the situation, would move mountains (or at least buy a plane ticket) to ensure you are safe and cared for during a difficult, painful, and potentially risky medical procedure.\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n1.  **Stop discussing the \"if he were in NY\" scenario until you know you are pregnant.**\n2.  **If you are pregnant and choose abortion, you must prioritize your safety and logistics.** You need a reliable support system, whether that is him or someone else.\n\n**Finding Support if He Fails You:**\n\nIf you are pregnant and need an abortion, and your boyfriend is not physically present, you are **not** alone.\n\n*   **Abortion Funds:** Organizations like the National Abortion Federation (NAF) or local abortion funds can often provide financial assistance, travel arrangements, and sometimes even a **safe place to stay (practical support)** and a **support person (an escort or volunteer)** to drive you to and from the clinic.\n*   **Clinic Resources:** Call the clinic where you plan to go. They often have resources or connections to volunteer networks who can help with rides and post-procedure care.\n\n---\n\n## Summary and Action Plan\n\nRight now, focus on these three things:\n\n1.  **Get Confirmation:** Take a definitive pregnancy test today, or schedule a blood test at a clinic (Planned Parenthood is highly recommended).\n2.  **Prioritize Safety:** If you are pregnant, make a decision about your options based on what is best for **you** and your future.\n3.  **Evaluate the Relationship:** Regardless of the pregnancy outcome, you need to seriously consider if this relationship is healthy, safe, and respectful, especially given the pattern of murky consent and his lack of commitment in a crisis.\n\nTake a deep breath. You are 18, and this is a massive amount of pressure. Be kind to yourself. You deserve a partner who respects your boundaries 100% of the time."
