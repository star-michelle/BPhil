As the title says, I have a consultation set up to discuss sterilization with my OB. I\u2019m in my late thirties, married with stepkids and not planning to have any bio kids. Because of this and the recent election, I\u2019d just prefer to get sterilized and not have to worry about birth control anymore. I also have a family history of uterine cancer and, to be honest, am not interested in menstruating anymore if I\u2019m not going to have children. My periods before BC were very, very unpleasant (heavy, lasting weeks at a time), but I\u2019ve been on BC in some form for nearly twenty years so there isn\u2019t a medical record of that. My periods on BC, say towards the end of the life cycle of my IUD, were also difficult but more manageable. I\u2019d prefer to not have to remain on BC post procedure.\n\nIs there any chance that, given my family and personal history, my OB will perform a hysterectomy? Has anyone been successful in getting this to happen? My OB is wonderful and very supportive, but I expect this to be an uphill battle regardless."

      "content": "This sounds like a very important conversation you are preparing for, and it's completely understandable why you are looking into permanent sterilization options, especially given your personal circumstances, family history, and desire to stop menstruating.\n\nIt's great that you have an appointment already scheduled with an OB who you feel is supportive. That is a huge first step.\n\nLet's break down your question about the chances of obtaining a hysterectomy for sterilization versus other options:\n\n### Understanding Hysterectomy for Sterilization\n\nA hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is definitively sterilizing, but it is typically considered a major surgery with a longer recovery time than a tubal ligation or salpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes). Because of this, medical guidelines generally recommend less invasive procedures for sterilization alone.\n\n**However, your situation is not just about sterilization.** You have several factors that strengthen the argument for a hysterectomy:\n\n1.  **Desire for Sterilization:** This is your primary goal.\n2.  **Desire to End Menstruation (Amenorrhea):** This is a significant quality-of-life factor.\n3.  **Family History of Uterine Cancer:** This introduces a medical risk factor that could potentially be mitigated by removing the uterus.\n4.  **History of Difficult Periods:** Even if the records are old, your testimony about the severity of your periods pre-BC and even towards the end of your IUD's efficacy is relevant to your current quality of life and future discomfort if you stop hormonal birth control.\n\n### Chances of Obtaining a Hysterectomy\n\nWhile it's impossible to give a definite percentage, your chances are significantly better than someone seeking a hysterectomy *only* for sterilization.\n\n**The strongest justification for a hysterectomy in your case will be combining the need for definitive sterilization with a medical or quality-of-life reason to remove the uterus.**\n\nHere is how you can approach the conversation, focusing on the points that medically justify the procedure:\n\n#### 1. Focus on Quality of Life and Menstruation\n\nThis is often the most persuasive non-cancer-related argument.\n\n*   **Be clear that your goal is definitive sterilization AND relief from menstruation.**\n*   Explain that your periods, when not managed by BC, were debilitating (heavy, lasting weeks).\n*   State clearly that you do not want to rely on hormonal birth control or other menstrual management methods (like ablation) post-sterilization. You want a permanent solution to both fertility and menstruation.\n*   **Ablation vs. Hysterectomy:** If the OB suggests endometrial ablation (burning the lining of the uterus to stop bleeding), you can state that while it addresses the bleeding, it doesn't address the cancer risk, and it sometimes fails, requiring further procedures.\n\n#### 2. Emphasize the Cancer Risk\n\nWhile a family history of uterine cancer is a concern, it may not be an *automatic* indication for prophylactic hysterectomy unless the cancer is linked to a known genetic mutation (like Lynch Syndrome).\n\n*   **Be prepared to discuss specifics:** Do you know which relative(s) had uterine cancer and at what age?\n*   **If you haven't been screened for genetic mutations (like Lynch Syndrome), your OB might suggest this first.** If a mutation is found, your chance of obtaining a hysterectomy skyrockets.\n*   **If no mutation is found,** you can still present the family history as a contributing factor, especially when combined with your other symptoms.\n\n#### 3. Discuss Alternatives to Hysterectomy\n\nYour OB is likely to first suggest the standard sterilization procedure: a **bilateral salpingectomy** (B/S, removal of the fallopian tubes). This procedure is now the gold standard for sterilization because it offers definitive sterilization and lowers the risk of ovarian cancer (as many ovarian cancers start in the fallopian tubes).\n\n*   **If the OB suggests B/S,** acknowledge that it provides sterilization, but explain that it *does not* address your other major concerns (menstruation and potential uterine cancer risk).\n*   **Your goal is to show the OB that a hysterectomy is the *only* procedure that meets all three of your needs (sterilization, amenorrhea, and risk reduction).**\n\n### What to Expect and Plan For\n\n*   **The \"Supportive\" OB:** A supportive OB is fantastic, but they must still adhere to medical necessity guidelines. If they feel your request is reasonable given the combined factors, they may be willing to fight for it with the hospital/insurance.\n*   **Insurance/Hospital:** Insurance companies are often the biggest hurdle, as a hysterectomy is more expensive and requires a longer hospital stay. Your OB may need to meticulously document your history of heavy bleeding (even if based on your testimony) and your cancer risk factors to justify the procedure as \"medically necessary.\"\n*   **If they refuse the hysterectomy:** Ask what the next best option would be that addresses your desire to stop menstruating. This is usually a combination of a bilateral salpingectomy **PLUS** an endometrial ablation. You can then weigh if that two-part procedure is acceptable to you.\n\n### Summary of Actionable Advice for Your Appointment\n\n1.  **Lead with the combination of issues:** \"Doctor, I am seeking permanent sterilization, and given my history of debilitating periods and family history of uterine cancer, I strongly believe a hysterectomy is the most appropriate single procedure for me.\"\n2.  **Be firm about not wanting to manage menstruation moving forward.** You do not want to rely on future hormones or additional procedures (like ablation).\n3.  **Be prepared to discuss your ovarian status:** You may want to keep your ovaries if they are healthy, as removing them (oophorectomy) would immediately induce menopause, which comes with its own set of health risks. A hysterectomy removes the uterus; it does not necessarily remove the ovaries.\n\nGood luck with your appointment. Prepare your points clearly, and remember that advocating for your own long-term health and quality of life is essential."
