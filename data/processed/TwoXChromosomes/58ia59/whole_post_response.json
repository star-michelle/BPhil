I work as an RN working on my BSN. I rent a nice house for us. Ultimately I want a home and family. But to cut the story short. I just got broke up with and ...this is a repeated pattern. I'm ready for a change. As much as I want to stay here and find love its not happening. So I'm ready to travel. I really need someone to talk to. I have no idea what Im doing or where to go.  I have already talked to a friend who will let me stay in his house for 2 months while I continue to work and save up money. I realize I have a car payment/insurance, two cats and a cell phone bill that I will need to pay at least three months in advance. \nThis is the hardest decision I have ever made, but I need advice and encouragement. \nI assume I will be able to do my online  courses from abroad. \nIs there anything I should prepare for?\n\nMy next steps include. Telling my landlord about this plan ( he wont' be happy)\n\nAnd telling my boss I need a month off of work. ( A very feasible possibility)\n\nPacking up all my stuff \n\nAnd then ulitimately leaving my daughter for 30 days while I do what I need to do in order to discover what will make me happy\n\nI mainly want to know how to use my cell phone. I called my Us cell company. I have a galaxy s7. I was told about how expensive it can be. So I thought maybe I could just maintain that line..while getting a rental? Or possibly even buy a phone card?\n\nMy next dilemma is where I'm going to go or stay. As a smaller female.. I am scared for my safety but right now .. I just want to take that risk to see Rome  and also travel to France as well. I thought about couch surfing. Are country to country flights cheaper within Europe? Any advice is very much appreciated. Leaving my daughter is so hard for me to do. She is the only one I have in my life. My mother is not  there for my and my father is dead. But i'm so depressed I feel I HAVE to do  this to make myself happy. "

      "content": "That sounds like a lot of intense feelings and big decisions all coming to a head right now. It takes a lot of courage to reach out when you're feeling this overwhelmed and ready for such a major change. Thank you for sharing all of this with me.\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you are feeling depressed and ready to shake things up, especially after a breakup that follows a repeated pattern. Wanting to prioritize your own happiness and well-being is a valid and important goal, and taking a break to focus on yourself can be incredibly restorative.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the different aspects of your plan. It sounds like you have already taken some really practical first steps, like arranging temporary accommodation to save money, which is smart planning.\n\nHere are some thoughts and advice regarding the areas you mentioned:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Planning and Logistics\n\n### Financial Preparation & The Three-Month Buffer\nIt\u2019s excellent that you\u2019ve identified your core fixed costs (car payment/insurance, phone bill, etc.) and plan to save three months in advance. This is a very responsible safety net.\n\n*   **Car:** Since you are keeping the car, make sure you have someone reliable who can check on it occasionally while you are gone, especially if it\u2019s parked outside.\n*   **Cats:** Who will be caring for your cats while you are abroad? This is a crucial detail to sort out well in advance. Will your friend who is letting you stay at their place watch them, or do you need to arrange a pet sitter?\n\n### Housing (The Landlord Conversation)\nYou mentioned your landlord won't be happy. Since you are renting a house, you need to review your lease agreement immediately.\n\n*   **Lease Terms:** Are you on a month-to-month lease, or do you have a fixed-term lease (e.g., 12 months)?\n    *   If you break a fixed-term lease, you may be financially responsible for rent until the landlord finds a new tenant, or for a specific penalty fee outlined in the contract.\n    *   If you are month-to-month, you likely need to give 30 or 60 days' written notice, depending on your state/lease.\n*   **Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate, but prioritize understanding your legal obligations first. If you are breaking a lease, having a few extra months of savings might be necessary to cover potential penalties.\n\n### Work (The Boss Conversation)\nIt's great that you feel a month off is feasible.\n\n*   **RN and BSN:** As you are working as an RN and pursuing your BSN, make sure this time off doesn't jeopardize your licensing or your progression toward the BSN.\n*   **Timing:** Once you have a clearer departure date, give your boss as much notice as possible (e.g., 6\u20138 weeks) to ensure coverage.\n\n### Online Classes (BSN)\nThis is a critical point that needs immediate verification.\n\n*   **IP Restrictions:** Some universities have strict rules about accessing their learning management systems (LMS) from outside the US due to licensing or security issues.\n*   **Time Zones:** You will be several hours ahead of the US East Coast (e.g., 6 hours ahead in Rome). Will you be able to meet deadlines, attend required synchronous sessions (if any), and access support easily?\n*   **Action Step:** Contact your BSN program advisor or the IT department **before** you leave and confirm that you can access all necessary materials and submit assignments while traveling in Europe.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Your Daughter and Emotional Well-being\n\nThis is the hardest part, and it's completely understandable that you are struggling with the guilt and sadness of leaving your daughter.\n\n> Leaving my daughter is so hard for me to do. She is the only one I have in my life. My mother is not there for my and my father is dead. But i'm so depressed I feel I HAVE to do this to make myself happy.\n\nIt is important to remember that taking care of yourself is taking care of your daughter. A mother who is mentally healthy and happy is better equipped to be present for her child. A month is a significant time, but it is temporary.\n\n*   **Custody Agreement:** Since you split custody, ensure your travel plans align with the existing custody order. You need to coordinate with her father about the 30-day period. He will likely take custody during that time.\n*   **Communication:** Plan ahead for regular, scheduled video calls (using Wi-Fi) with your daughter while you are gone. Show her pictures, tell her stories, and keep the connection strong. Reassure her that you are taking this trip to recharge, and that you will be back.\n*   **Pre-Departure Support:** Before you leave, it might be beneficial to talk to a professional counselor or therapist. They can help you process the depression, the guilt about leaving, and the underlying patterns in your life. This support can continue via virtual sessions while you are saving money or even while you are abroad.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Travel Logistics (Safety, Destination, and Communication)\n\n### Safety as a Solo Female Traveler\nYour concern about safety is valid, especially traveling alone to big European cities like Rome and Paris.\n\n*   **General Safety:** Stick to well-lit, populated areas, be aware of your surroundings (especially pickpockets in crowded tourist areas), and avoid walking alone late at night when possible.\n*   **Accommodation Vetting:** If you use Couchsurfing or hostels, read reviews very carefully. Look for places run by other women or couples, and those with hundreds of positive reviews. Reputable hostels often have female-only dorms, which can increase comfort and security.\n*   **Check-Ins:** Establish a routine of checking in daily with a trusted person back home (like the friend you are staying with) and let them know where you are staying each night.\n\n### Destination and Budget Travel\nRome and France (assuming Paris) are fantastic choices, but they are generally expensive cities.\n\n*   **Couchsurfing:** This can be a great way to save money and meet locals, but it requires a high degree of trust and vetting (as mentioned above). You might start with reputable **hostels** first, as they offer community and security for a relatively low cost.\n*   **Country-to-Country Flights in Europe:** Yes, flights within Europe, especially through budget carriers like **Ryanair, easyJet, Wizz Air, and Vueling**, can be incredibly cheap if booked in advance (sometimes less than $50).\n    *   **The Catch:** These flights charge heavily for checked luggage and often fly into secondary, less convenient airports. You will need to travel very light (carry-on only) to keep costs down.\n*   **Alternative Transport:** For travel between countries that are closer (like Paris to certain parts of Italy), consider high-speed trains (like TGV or Frecciarossa) or overnight buses (like FlixBus). Buses are the cheapest option, though the slowest.\n\n### Cell Phone Dilemma (The Galaxy S7)\n\nYou are right to be concerned about US roaming costs\u2014they are astronomical. Your US provider gave you the standard warning.\n\nThe best solution for your Galaxy S7 is usually the simplest and cheapest:\n\n1.  **Keep Your US Line Active:** Keep your US number active for things like bank verification codes, but put it on the cheapest possible plan (or the international \"pause\" rate, if your carrier offers one).\n2.  **Use a Local European SIM Card:**\n    *   Since the Galaxy S7 is an older phone, you need to ensure it is **unlocked** by your US carrier. Call them and confirm your phone is ready for use on other networks.\n    *   Once you arrive in your first European country (e.g., Rome), buy a local prepaid SIM card (from carriers like Vodafone, Orange, or TIM).\n    *   **The EU Roaming Rule:** Thanks to EU regulations, a SIM card purchased in one EU country (like Italy) will generally work across all other EU countries (like France) with no extra roaming charges. You get to use your data and minutes across the entire zone.\n    *   This is the most cost-effective way to get reliable data (for maps, communicating with your daughter via WhatsApp/FaceTime over Wi-Fi, and booking accommodations).\n\n*   **Phone Card/Rentals:** Phone cards are generally obsolete and complicated for modern travelers. Phone rentals are expensive. A local SIM is the standard, easy solution.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Immediate Next Steps:\n\n1.  **Verify BSN Access:** Contact your school immediately to confirm online access from Europe.\n2.  **Review Lease:** Understand your financial obligations regarding breaking your lease agreement.\n3.  **Secure Pet Care:** Finalize the arrangements for your two cats for the duration of your trip.\n4.  **Confirm Phone Status:** Call your US carrier and confirm your Galaxy S7 is **unlocked** for international SIM cards.\n5.  **Talk to Co-Parent:** Discuss the 30-day custody schedule with your daughter\u2019s father.\n\nThis journey is a huge step toward prioritizing your happiness. It\u2019s okay to be scared, but you are also showing tremendous resilience and determination by planning this out so thoroughly. You are taking charge of your life, and that is something to be proud of."
