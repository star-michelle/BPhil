At first he just started appearing at the store near me, trying to make smalltalk etc. But I kept running away so now when I've tried to leave the building I see him outside and I have to turn back and cancel my plans. Luckily I'm a student and I don't work, so I can just miss some lectures. Last month he got my phonenumber. I still don't know how, and I changed it. He found it again. Then he found my facebook account (might have been earlier, I don't really use fb). I deleted all of my social media accounts, and started ordering in groceries. But in two weeks I will have to leave my apartment again to study. The police are really doing their best and I'm thankful for them, but I don't know his name, he keeps using different fb accounts, different phone numbers and emails. So before they find him I'd like to stay hidden. I've been living in my current apartment for 5 years now and I love it so much, moving is my last option. Is there anything to do so he would just forget about me, like faking my death?"

      "content": "This is an absolutely terrifying and exhausting situation, and I am so incredibly sorry that you are going through this. Please know that your fear is completely justified, and you have done nothing wrong. The desperation you feel\u2014even considering extreme measures like faking your death\u2014is a direct result of the intense trauma and harassment you are enduring.\n\nIt is crucial that we focus on your immediate safety and practical steps, and I want to assure you that you are being heard here.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Immediate Professional Support (Please Contact NOW)\n\nWhile the police are doing their best, you need support from professionals who specialize in **sexual assault advocacy and stalking safety planning**. These organizations can help you strategize about the next two weeks and beyond, often anonymously and 24/7.\n\n**They are trained to help people in your exact situation.**\n\n*   **Sexual Assault Hotline/Crisis Center:** Search for your local sexual assault resource center. They can provide confidential counseling, legal advocacy, and detailed safety plans tailored to stalking situations.\n*   **Stalking Resource Centers:** These organizations focus specifically on how to manage and legally respond to a stalker, including digital harassment.\n\nA safety advocate can sit down with you (virtually or in person) and help you decide the safest steps regarding your apartment, your upcoming studies, and how to maximize the police investigation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Addressing the \"Faking Death\" Idea\n\nI understand that the idea of faking your death comes from a place of deep desperation\u2014you want him to simply stop and move on.\n\n**However, this is not a safe, viable, or effective strategy.**\n\n1.  **It does not guarantee safety:** Dedicated stalkers often see \"death\" as a new challenge or a confirmation of their power, and they may escalate their behavior to try and confirm it.\n2.  **It complicates the investigation:** The police need a clear, ongoing pattern of harassment to build a strong case. Faking your death would confuse the legal process and make it harder for them to track and arrest him.\n3.  **It puts you at greater risk:** To effectively fake your death, you would have to involve others, potentially exposing them to risk or creating a situation where your location is accidentally compromised.\n\nWe need to focus your energy on practical, proven safety measures that will help the police find him and keep you safe in the meantime.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Safety Planning for the Next Two Weeks\n\nYour priority right now is maintaining absolute silence and safety until you need to leave for your studies.\n\n### A. Digital Security and Evidence Collection\n\nYou are doing a great job deleting social media and changing your phone number. You must maintain this level of digital silence.\n\n*   **Continue Documentation:** Every single attempt he makes to contact you\u2014new phone numbers, new emails, new social media accounts, failed login attempts on your old accounts\u2014must be documented. **Do not delete them.** Take screenshots and immediately forward this evidence to the police officer assigned to your case. This is crucial for establishing the pattern of stalking.\n*   **Digital Firewall:** If you haven't already, ensure your email address is completely private. Do not use public Wi-Fi. Do not log into any accounts that might still link back to old information.\n*   **Smart Device Review:** Check any smart devices (smart speakers, fitness trackers, etc.) that might have location settings enabled and turn them off.\n*   **New Phone Protocol:** When you get a new phone number, only give it to a handful of trusted people and ensure they understand the severity of the situation and why they cannot share it.\n\n### B. Physical Security\n\nWhile you are staying in your apartment, maximize security:\n\n*   **Vary Your Schedule (Even Inside):** If he is watching your building, try not to have predictable patterns (like lights always on at 9 PM).\n*   **Reinforce Doors and Windows:** If possible, install extra locks, door wedges, or a portable security alarm on your main door.\n*   **Never Open the Door:** Do not answer the door for anyone you are not expecting, even delivery people. Use a peephole or security camera app to check first.\n*   **Curtains and Blinds:** Keep them closed 24/7.\n\n### C. Addressing the Two-Week Deadline (The Study Requirement)\n\nThis is your most immediate challenge. You need a safe place to go that he does not know about.\n\n1.  **Talk to Your University/College:** Contact the student support or security services immediately. Explain your situation (you are being stalked and are working with the police).\n    *   **Can they provide temporary, secure housing?** Many universities have emergency housing for students in crisis that is off-campus and discreet.\n    *   **Can they offer remote study options?** Can you attend lectures or complete work remotely for a few weeks while the police close in?\n    *   **Can they provide a security escort?** If you absolutely must attend in person, ask if the campus security can meet you at a secure location and escort you.\n\n2.  **Temporary Relocation:** If you do not want to move permanently, you should consider a temporary, short-term move for your safety.\n    *   **Trusted Friend/Family Member:** Can you stay with a trusted friend or family member who lives far away, or perhaps even in a different city, for a few weeks? **Crucially, this person must not know your address, and you must not give them your current location.**\n    *   **AirBnB/Hotel:** If you have the financial means, staying at a hotel or short-term rental far away, paid for in cash or via a new, secure payment method, might be necessary.\n\n**Do not tell anyone (except the police and your professional safety advocate) where you are going.** If you move temporarily, you must act as if you have vanished.\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Next Steps\n\n1.  **Call a Sexual Assault/Stalking Advocate immediately.** They are your best resource for creating a detailed safety plan.\n2.  **Keep logging evidence** and sending it directly to the police.\n3.  **Contact your university** about temporary, secure housing or remote study options for the next few weeks.\n4.  **Do not move out of your apartment permanently yet** if you truly wish to avoid it, but be prepared to relocate temporarily for your safety until the police can identify and locate him."
