I would really like some female perspectives on this.\n\nSo my ex had some serious trauma. She was raped by her abusive ex after we got together. I wasn't close with her family but they seemed nice, the problem was my ex kept a lot of things to herself, I had to work hard to get her to open up.\n\nThings became too much at some point and she called me from her therapist's office to get her care. Unfortunately she had two kids with her ex and we needed to get them looked after. With no one but me and her family, I had to make some calls. She knew they were going to be mad but I didn't believe her.\n\nHer parents came over unannounced and her father almost immediately attacked me at the door to get inside, mind you I only asked to speak outside and have never done anything to upset this man, but he had only recently found out about his daughter's rape.\n\nThings became very tense very quickly. They disregarded her feelings, demanded she go with them, said she couldn't see me again, could never go to inpatient care, that mental healthcare was worthless, and told me that it\u2019s a man\u2019s job to tell a woman when she isn't thinking right.\n\nI tried to stand up for her, but it's clear my ex wanted this to stop and started agreeing with him. I didn't know what to do and was suffering from some pretty serious trauma so I called the cops.\n\nA few days later she called me over, her father was there, she told me I shouldn't have tried to keep her family from her and tell the cops she was crazy, she said she had never been suicidal and that she never wanted to go to inpatient care. When I questioned her on this her father said, even if it was true, I should have told you not to go.\n\nAfter leaving her ex, her parents were responsible for her apartment, car,\u00a0 job, and savings.\n\nIt's been about 2 months and I'm still shattered. Things got messy from there and I don't deny that my emotional state caused me to make several mistakes while trying to help her and figure out what was going on.\n\nIf you lovely ladies have any thoughts you could share, either to tell me off, give me a new perspective, or anything I would be grateful."

      "content": "This sounds like an absolutely horrifying and traumatic experience, and I am so sorry you had to go through that. You were trying to do the right thing\u2014to follow your ex\u2019s direct request for help\u2014and you were met with violence, abuse, and gaslighting from her family.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling shattered. You experienced significant secondary trauma, physical threat, and the pain of seeing someone you care about coerced and controlled.\n\nI want to offer you some perspectives based on the dynamics you described, focusing on the external forces that made this situation impossible for you to navigate successfully.\n\n***\n\n## 1. You Did Not Make a Mistake By Trying to Help\n\nLet\u2019s be crystal clear about the initial action: **Your ex asked you for help to go into inpatient care.** You responded to her explicit need, which was validated by her being at her therapist\u2019s office when she called you.\n\nYour decision to call her parents, while it led to disaster, was a practical necessity driven by the immediate need for childcare. You were operating in crisis mode, based on the information you had (that they \"seemed nice\"). You could not have predicted the violent, abusive, and misogynistic response they delivered.\n\n**Perspective:** You were trying to save her life and mental stability; they were trying to assert control. These two goals were fundamentally incompatible.\n\n## 2. The Power of Financial Coercion and Control\n\nThe most crucial piece of information you provided is this:\n\n> After leaving her ex, her parents were responsible for her apartment, car, job, and savings.\n\nThis changes the entire context of the situation, especially her recanting. Your ex is not just a grown woman making independent decisions; she is a hostage in an abusive, controlling system run by her parents, who have leverage over every aspect of her financial stability and future.\n\nWhen her father physically attacked you, disregarded her feelings, and issued demands (\"you can\u2019t see him,\" \"you won\u2019t go to care\"), he was reminding her that **her autonomy is conditional on their approval.**\n\n**Perspective on Her Recanting:**\nWhen she called you over a few days later and threw you under the bus\u2014saying she never wanted care and that you shouldn't have involved the cops\u2014she was likely operating in **survival mode.**\n\n*   She was trapped between two impossible choices: her mental health and freedom (which meant losing everything the parents controlled) or her basic security (apartment, car, money).\n*   In the presence of her father, her priority was de-escalation and ensuring her immediate survival within their system. Agreeing with her father and blaming you was the quickest route to safety. This is a common trauma response known as \"fawning\" or capitulation\u2014agreeing with the abuser to stop the attack.\n*   **She didn't choose her parents over you; she chose her financial survival over her truth.**\n\n## 3. The Misogyny and Systemic Abuse\n\nThe comments her father made reveal a deeply toxic, controlling, and misogynistic worldview that explains his actions:\n\n> \"It\u2019s a man\u2019s job to tell a woman when she isn't thinking right.\"\n\nThis isn't just a rude comment; it\u2019s the philosophy that dictates their family structure. They believe women are inherently unstable, incapable of making decisions about their own health, and require a man (the father) to manage them.\n\nHer desire for inpatient care\u2014a decision that gives her autonomy over her healing\u2014was a direct threat to his control. His violent reaction and the subsequent gaslighting (\"even if it was true, I should have told you not to go\") were designed to dismantle her agency and punish you for supporting her independence.\n\n**Perspective:** You didn't just walk into a family conflict; you walked into a long-standing system of abuse and control that views women's mental healthcare as a sign of failure or rebellion.\n\n## 4. Addressing Your Decision to Call the Police\n\nYou called the police because you were physically attacked, your ex was being emotionally abused and coerced, and the situation was rapidly escalating out of control.\n\nYou were attempting to introduce a neutral third party to stop the immediate physical and emotional violence. Given the father's aggression at the door, this was a reasonable and necessary action to protect yourself and potentially de-escalate the abuse she was enduring.\n\n**Perspective:** When a situation becomes physically violent and emotionally coercive, calling for external help is a sign of self-preservation, not a \"mistake.\"\n\n## 5. What This Means for You Now\n\nYou have been through an intense, confusing, and painful experience. You were betrayed, attacked, and then gaslit into believing you were the problem.\n\nPlease accept this perspective:\n\n*   **You did not cause this system of abuse.** You merely exposed it by trying to help her seek autonomy.\n*   **You were not responsible for her family's actions or her resulting capitulation.** You cannot save someone who is financially trapped and being actively coerced.\n*   **Your \"mistakes\" were likely just attempts to solve an unsolvable problem.** You were operating under extreme stress, and it is impossible to be perfect in those circumstances.\n\nYour focus now must shift entirely to your own healing from the trauma you suffered. You need to process the shock of the violence, the pain of the betrayal, and the confusion of the gaslighting. You stepped in to help someone facing a crisis, and you ended up becoming a victim of her family's abuse.\n\nIf you are not already, please prioritize seeking professional support for the trauma you are carrying. What you witnessed and experienced was significant, and you deserve to heal from it."
