      "content": "Gosh i need some help here, ladies\n\nSo, to make a long story short, me and my fiance have been together for 9 years. We have a son whos 3. \nIve finally gotten a job i really love after two years at home with my son. \n\nI really feel ive grown so much these three months that ive had the job. Its like ive found my old self again and Im good at this job! \n\nSo, i work in a male dominated field. And ive met someone, hes a coworker and were the two youngest here, so naturally we talk. \nI feel like theres this strong chemistry, and I think about him a lot. We were at a work thing two weeks ago where we talked a lot, probably flirted a bit too... We were two of the four last people to leave. \n\nRight now its truly only a work crush, we chitchat and glance at each other many times in a day. \n\nI believe that this crush has happened because things at home isnt the best right now. We are both so busy and tired at night. We never have sex anymore and when we do, i have to initiate. I feel like we have become roommates. \nIm sure that if things had amazing at home, then my crush probably wouldnt have happened. \n\nIm so frustrated and sad right now, and I dont have anyone to talk to about this. Has anyone been in my shoes? Like, what do I do?"

      "content": "This sounds like a really complicated and emotionally draining situation, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling frustrated and sad right now. It takes a lot of courage to acknowledge these feelings and reach out for support. Please know that you are definitely not alone in experiencing these kinds of conflicting emotions and situations.\n\nIt\u2019s fantastic news that you\u2019ve found a job you love and that you feel like you\u2019ve rediscovered your old self! That kind of personal growth and confidence boost is huge, and it naturally changes your perspective on things.\n\nLet's break down what you've shared. You're dealing with two interconnected issues:\n\n1.  **The state of your long-term relationship at home:** Feeling like roommates, lack of intimacy, and feeling like you always have to initiate.\n2.  **The intense work crush:** The chemistry, the flirting, and the fact that you think about him often.\n\nIt\u2019s very insightful of you to connect the crush to the dissatisfaction at home. Often, when we feel emotionally or physically distant from our primary partner, our minds and hearts naturally seek that connection, validation, and excitement elsewhere\u2014even if it's just a fantasy or a crush.\n\n### What to Do Next\n\nYou asked, \"What do I do?\" Since this involves both your marriage and your job, let's look at some steps you can take, focusing first on **clarity** and **boundary setting.**\n\n---\n\n### Phase 1: Gaining Clarity and Setting Boundaries\n\n#### 1. Prioritize Your Relationship at Home (The Foundation)\n\nBefore you decide anything about the crush, you need to address the root cause: the feeling of being roommates with your fianc\u00e9. The crush is likely a symptom, not the disease.\n\n*   **Talk to your Fianc\u00e9 (The Hard Part):** You need to communicate your feelings about the relationship itself, without mentioning the coworker. Use \"I\" statements to describe your feelings, not \"you\" statements to assign blame.\n    *   *Example:* \"I feel like we've drifted apart lately, and I miss feeling connected to you,\" or \"I feel lonely when we get home and we don't spend quality time together.\"\n*   **Focus on the \"Roommate\" Issue:** Express how much you miss the passion and intimacy. Suggest setting aside a specific time, even just once a week, for a \"date night\" or \"connection time\" (which could be anything from deep conversation to intimacy).\n*   **Give it a Real Effort:** See if focusing on your home relationship can reignite the spark. If you can fix the underlying issues, the need for the excitement of the crush will likely fade naturally.\n\n#### 2. Establish Strict Boundaries at Work\n\nThis is crucial for protecting your job, your reputation, and your home life. You need to stop the emotional escalation of the crush *right now* while you figure things out at home.\n\n*   **Limit Non-Work Interaction:** Keep conversations strictly professional. If he tries to flirt or steer the conversation toward personal topics, politely bring it back to work.\n    *   *Example:* If he says something flirty, you can just smile and say, \"Anyway, about that report...\"\n*   **Avoid One-on-One Social Situations:** Do not be alone with him outside of necessary work tasks (no lingering after work, no private lunches, no texting outside of professional needs). If there's another work event, make sure you are always with a group.\n*   **Acknowledge the Chemistry, But Don't Feed It:** You know the chemistry is there, but you don't have to act on it. Every time you catch yourself thinking about him, gently redirect your thoughts back to your fianc\u00e9 or your son.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Self-Reflection\n\nThis is also a time to reflect on what the crush is giving you that you feel is missing at home:\n\n*   **Excitement/Novelty:** Your job is new, and this person is new. That's inherently exciting.\n*   **Validation/Attention:** He's giving you attention and making you feel seen as an attractive woman, not just a mom/fianc\u00e9e.\n*   **Feeling \"Your Old Self\":** He represents the successful, confident person you are now, separate from your home responsibilities.\n\nCan you get some of that validation and excitement from other sources that don't threaten your relationship? Maybe a new hobby, time with friends, or channeling that energy back into your relationship with your fianc\u00e9?\n\n---\n\n**You are at a crossroads. You have the power to choose which path you want to take.**\n\n*   **Path A:** Work on your relationship with your fianc\u00e9, set firm boundaries at work, and let the crush fade.\n*   **Path B:** Continue to let the crush escalate while ignoring the issues at home, which will inevitably lead to a very difficult situation down the line.\n\nMost people who have been in your shoes would advise you to choose Path A first. Give your 9-year relationship and your family a chance to thrive by addressing the actual problems you identified.\n\n**How do you feel about the idea of talking to your fianc\u00e9 about the distance you're feeling, even though it's scary?**"
