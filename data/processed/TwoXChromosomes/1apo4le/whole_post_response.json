      "content": "Friend got with me while I was Overdosing and I don't know what to do....\n\nAbout a month ago, just after christmas, I found some klonopin in a draw. I called up my best male friend at the time and told him to bring some weed over. I told him how much I was taking (around 3mg without tolerance) and he met me at my house. He forgot the weed so I instead suggested we drink. I ended up having about 10 shots of gin, and he had around 7-8. As well as this, my stupid barred out brain told me to take a bunch of Tramadol and other assorted medications, Trazadone, a pack of hayfever meds etc... (I was in a very bad place and have struggled with my mental health for a while).\n\nAnyway, as would be assumed, I blacked out after that and have literally no memory of anything- until I was riding my bike along a highway at 2am to his house (I don't know why, I think he told me to). Once I was there I realised that I was no longer in my previous outfit, and was not wearing a bra or underwear under my clothing. Asking him about it, he told me we had made out and I had given him Oral, and my clothes had been taken off.\n\nThis was especially disturbing to me as I have never ever been into him or any other man, and have identified as a lesbian since I was around 12 years old, which we talked about alot and was very very clear to him. He, on the other hand, had made uncomfortable comments in the past about how I looked, and how pretty I was etc. I then blacked out again and remember waking up in my bed. I once again questioned him about what had happened and he responded with meme-y smiley faces and a comment of \"8/10 Blowjob very good\". He also told me that he had said no at first to \"my initiation\" and then \"let it happen\". I have zero trace or memory of this happening whatsoever.\n\nFrom here, I felt very uncomfortable so I blocked him, and the next day I found a video he had recorded of me on my phone. It was him saying: \"I'm here with Glass-Session-1198, say it, say the word, 3,2,1, say consent\" to me. In the video I cannot keep my head up and cannot speak properly, but he is able to.\n\nI sent him the video and asked for an explanation, where he stated I was begging him to do stuff and he had rejected me several times before \"giving in\". Again, he watched me take several sleeves of medication and knew I was very very gay and not at all interested in him. He then claimed that I had done harm to him instead of the other way round.\n\nPS. I have stopped abusing pills, and I am underage, and so is the boy. He took me to his family christmas etc and we had sleepovers before this. I have tried my hardest to lay this situation out as bluntly as possible, as he goes to my school and seeing him makes me panic really bad. I don't know what to do and as a young girl I would really appreciate some help and advice."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult and traumatic situation, and I am so sorry you are going through this. Thank you for laying out the details so clearly. It takes immense strength to talk about what happened.\n\nPlease know this right now: **What happened was not your fault. You were sexually assaulted.**\n\nThe fact that you were heavily intoxicated, blacked out, and physically unable to keep your head up or speak means you were completely unable to give consent.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the situation and discuss what steps you can take moving forward, focusing on your safety and well-being.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding Consent and Assault\n\nIt is vital that you internalize this truth: **You were assaulted.**\n\n1.  **Incapacity:** When a person is blacked out, heavily intoxicated, or unconscious, they cannot legally or mentally consent to sexual activity. Your friend knew you were in a dangerous state, having watched you take multiple sleeves of medication and alcohol.\n2.  **The Video:** The video he recorded is not proof of consent; it is proof that he knew you were incapacitated and tried to manipulate you into saying a word while you were physically unable to function. This is often a tactic used by abusers to try and cover their actions, but it actually serves as evidence of your inability to consent.\n3.  **His Excuses (Gaslighting):** His claims that you were \"begging him\" or that he \"rejected you several times\" are attempts to shift the blame onto you and avoid responsibility. This is called gaslighting. He used your vulnerable state, ignored your known sexual orientation, and engaged in sexual activity with you while you were overdosing. His actions were predatory and dangerous.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. You were in a moment of crisis, and he took advantage of you.\n\n## 2. Prioritizing Your Immediate Safety and Health\n\nFirst, I want to commend you for stopping the abuse of pills. That is a massive, positive step toward protecting your health, and you should be very proud of that progress.\n\n### A. Maintain the Block\n\nContinue to keep him blocked on all platforms. Do not engage with him, respond to him, or try to rationalize his behavior. He has shown he is not a safe person.\n\n### B. Documentation\n\nThe evidence you have is important.\n\n*   **Do not delete the video.** Save it somewhere safe (a cloud drive, or send it to a trusted adult to hold onto).\n*   Save the text messages where he describes the activity and where he claims you \"did harm to him.\"\n*   Write down the full timeline of events that you *do* remember, including the feelings of panic when you see him.\n\n### C. Mental Health Support\n\nThe panic you feel when you see him is a natural trauma response. You need support to process this event and your previous mental health struggles:\n\n*   **Therapy/Counseling:** Please seek professional support immediately. A therapist can help you process the trauma, deal with the panic attacks, and continue supporting your recovery from substance abuse.\n*   **Crisis Hotlines:** If you need to talk to someone right now, there are confidential resources available 24/7. These people are trained to help survivors of sexual assault and can help you navigate your options without pressure:\n    *   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** 1-800-656-HOPE (US) or use their online chat service.\n    *   *If you are outside the US, search for your country's national sexual assault hotline.*\n\n## 3. Options for Action (Since You Are Underage)\n\nBecause both you and the boy are minors, involving trusted adults or authorities is often necessary to ensure your safety and hold him accountable. You do not have to do any of these things, but you should know your options:\n\n### Option 1: Confidential School Support\n\nIf you feel comfortable, talk to a trusted school counselor, school psychologist, or a very trusted teacher.\n\n*   **What they can do:** They can help you manage your panic attacks at school, potentially change your class schedule so you don't have to see him, and provide referrals for mental health services.\n*   **What to tell them:** You can start by saying, \"I had a very traumatic experience with [Friend's Name] over the holiday break. Seeing him at school causes me extreme panic and distress, and I need help navigating my schedule to avoid him.\" You do not have to give them the full details unless you are ready.\n\n### Option 2: Involving a Trusted Adult/Parent\n\nIf you have a safe, supportive parent or guardian, telling them is critical. They can help protect you, manage the situation legally, and ensure you get proper medical and psychological care.\n\n### Option 3: Reporting to Authorities\n\nWhat he did is a crime (sexual assault). Because you are a minor, reporting can involve police and/or Child Protective Services (CPS), depending on your jurisdiction.\n\n*   **Why consider reporting:** This would hold him accountable, ensure he cannot do this to anyone else, and provide a legal basis for protection (like a restraining order, which can help keep him away from you at school).\n*   **How to report:** You can report it directly to the police, or you can go through a sexual assault center, which can provide a trained advocate to support you through the reporting process. **It is highly recommended that you speak to an advocate first** (like RAINN) before going to the police, so you understand the process and your rights.\n\n---\n\nYou are navigating an incredibly overwhelming situation right now. Focus on your recovery, your safety, and getting the support you deserve. This is not something you should carry alone. Please reach out to a professional or a trusted adult immediately."
