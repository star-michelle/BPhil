I never said no and let him keep doing it so I feel guilty for being so disgusted and angry with him. \n\nCan someone provide some insight on this? Anything is helpful. Thanks"

      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this very difficult experience. I hear how conflicted, violated, and confused you feel right now. It is completely understandable that you are looking for clarity and support.\n\nI am here to listen and offer some perspective on the dynamics you described. Please know that your feelings of being violated, disgusted, and angry are valid, regardless of whether you said \"no\" or not.\n\nLet's look at a few key aspects of what you described, focusing on consent.\n\n***\n\n## Understanding Consent\n\nThe foundation of any sexual activity is **consent**. Consent must be:\n\n1.  **Affirmative:** It must be a clear, enthusiastic, and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Silence, passivity, or lack of resistance is **not** consent.\n2.  **Ongoing:** Consent can be withdrawn at any time, and it needs to be present for every stage of the sexual activity.\n3.  **Informed:** You must know what you are consenting to.\n4.  **Conscious:** This is the most critical point in your situation. **A person who is asleep or unconscious cannot give consent.**\n\n### Applying this to Your Situation:\n\nYou mentioned: **\"A couple of times I have woken up to him touching me/grinding on me/stimulating me in my sleep.\"**\n\nIf he initiated sexual contact while you were asleep, or if he continued the activity before you were fully awake, **that is an act without consent.**\n\nEven if you woke up and stayed still, the initial act was non-consensual because you were asleep when it started.\n\n## Addressing Your Conflict and Guilt\n\nIt is very common to feel guilt, confusion, or responsibility when you have been violated, but it is crucial to understand that **the fault is not yours.**\n\n### 1. \"I never verbally said no when I have woken up to it and kinda just let it happen...\"\n\nWhen someone freezes or stays still during a frightening or violating experience, this is a very common biological response. It's often called the **\"freeze\" response** (alongside fight or flight). Your body is trying to protect itself, and sometimes that means minimizing movement to make the situation end faster or avoid escalation.\n\n*   **Staying still is not consent.**\n*   **Silence is not consent.**\n*   The fact that you felt \"violated,\" \"disgusted,\" and \"angry\" clearly shows that you did not want this to happen.\n\n### 2. \"I don\u2019t know if I can call it SA because I never communicated that this was a problem...\"\n\nThe responsibility to ensure consent rests entirely on the person initiating the sexual activity\u2014in this case, your boyfriend. He needs to know that you are fully awake, aware, and enthusiastically agreeing to the activity.\n\nIf he is engaging in sexual contact while you are asleep, he is knowingly proceeding without your ability to consent. This behavior meets the definition of **sexual assault.**\n\n***\n\n## Next Steps and Support\n\nWhat you experienced sounds incredibly painful and confusing. Given that these feelings of violation are so strong, addressing this situation is essential for your well-being.\n\n### 1. Prioritize Your Safety and Feelings\n\n*   **Acknowledge your feelings:** It is okay to be angry, disgusted, and hurt. These feelings are telling you that a boundary was crossed.\n*   **What do you need right now?** Do you need space from him? Do you need to talk to him? Do you need professional support?\n\n### 2. Seeking Professional Support\n\nI strongly recommend reaching out to trained professionals who can offer confidential and specialized support:\n\n*   **Crisis Hotlines:** These resources are available 24/7 and can help you process what happened and discuss options in a safe space.\n    *   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network) National Hotline:** 1-800-656-HOPE (US)\n*   **Therapy:** A therapist specializing in trauma or relationship dynamics can help you unpack your feelings of guilt, violation, and confusion, and help you determine healthy boundaries moving forward.\n\n### 3. Communicating with Your Boyfriend (Optional, and only if you feel safe)\n\nIf you choose to address this with him, it can be extremely difficult. You need to be prepared for his reaction (denial, defensiveness, or apology).\n\nIf you decide to talk, you could try to focus on your feelings and boundaries:\n\n*   *\"I need to talk about something that has happened when I stay over. When I wake up to you touching me while I am sleeping, I feel violated and disgusted. I need you to know that I cannot consent when I am asleep, and I need you to stop all sexual touching when I am not fully awake and actively agreeing to it.\"*\n\n***\n\n**I want to reiterate: What happened to you was not your fault. You did not miscommunicate. A person who is asleep cannot consent, and proceeding with sexual contact under those circumstances is sexual assault.**\n\nHow can I best support you right now? Are there any specific thoughts or questions you have that we can focus on?"
