      "content": "Really starting to feel the pressure\n\nHi all! \n\nI hope this is the right thread to post in, if not feel free to point me in the right direction.\n\nA little back story: I'm a 22F, live in a fairly large (also fairly liberal) city, have a job at a tech start up, and no college education. \n\nMy boyfriend and I moved to this city a couple years ago after being together for 3 years (at the time) and things just sort of started falling into place. Well, I recently decided to completely switch my career path and enroll in college to become a K-12 teacher. This came as a big surprise to my partner but he has been amazingly supportive. After telling my family and friends about my new endeavors I got some responses that really threw me off. i.e: when will you have time to have kids, why haven't you gotten married, what if you don't make a lot of money, and so on. These responses have gotten me thinking I'm doing something terribly wrong and that things will just fail miserably.\n\nI just wanted to ask all of you if you've experienced something like this. If so, how'd you feel about it? What was your answer to get things on the right track?\n\nTL;DR being pressured into marriage, kids, etc. while trying to pursue a passion. Causing A LOT of anxiety and uncertainty. "

      "content": "This sounds like a really tough spot to be in, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling a lot of anxiety and uncertainty right now. It takes a lot of courage to completely switch career paths and enroll in college, especially when you already had a stable job. That's a huge step!\n\nFirst off, yes, you are absolutely in the right place to share this. What you're experiencing is incredibly common, even though it feels isolating when it's happening to you.\n\nIt\u2019s great that your partner has been so supportive\u2014that\u2019s a fantastic foundation to have while you navigate these changes.\n\nLet's talk about those reactions you got from family and friends:\n\n### 1. The Experience of Pressure\n\nWhat you're feeling is valid. Many people, especially women in their early twenties, face immense pressure from family and society when they deviate from the \"traditional timeline.\" Your family and friends, even if they mean well, are projecting their own expectations, fears, and timelines onto your life.\n\n*   **You are not doing anything wrong.** You are actively pursuing a passion and investing in your future. That is the opposite of failing.\n*   **The anxiety is a normal reaction** to having your decisions questioned by people you care about. When multiple people start asking, \"What about X?\" it naturally makes you doubt your own path.\n\n### 2. How People Feel About It\n\nWhen others have experienced this kind of pressure, the feelings are usually a mix of:\n\n*   **Frustration:** \"Why can't they just be happy for me?\"\n*   **Guilt:** \"Maybe they're right, maybe I should be prioritizing marriage/kids.\"\n*   **Defensiveness:** Feeling the need to constantly justify decisions that should be personal.\n*   **Empowerment (eventually):** Realizing that your life is yours to design.\n\n### 3. How to Get Things Back on the Right Track\n\nThe \"right track\" here is the one you are setting for yourself\u2014the path toward becoming a K-12 teacher. Here are a few ways people manage these external pressures:\n\n#### A. Setting Boundaries and Scripts\n\nYou don't owe anyone a detailed explanation of your life choices, especially not the timeline for your marriage or fertility. Having a few pre-prepared, polite, but firm responses can help you shut down the conversation quickly and reduce your anxiety about these interactions.\n\n**For questions like, \"When will you have time to have kids?\" or \"Why haven't you gotten married?\"**\n\n*   **The Redirect:** \"We're focusing on our careers right now, but thank you for asking!\"\n*   **The Boundary Setter:** \"That's a conversation for my partner and me, not for general discussion. I'm really excited to talk about my new classes, though!\"\n*   **The Humor/Deflection:** (Said with a smile) \"One big life change at a time! Right now, I'm focusing on becoming a great teacher.\"\n\n**For questions about money (\"What if you don't make a lot of money?\"):**\n\n*   **The Value Statement:** \"I've done the research, and while it's not the tech startup salary, I'm pursuing this because the fulfillment and impact are more important to me than the paycheck.\"\n*   **The Practical Answer:** \"I'm comfortable with the financial plan we have in place, and I'm really looking forward to a career I genuinely love.\"\n\n#### B. Focus on Your \"Why\"\n\nWhen the anxiety hits, remind yourself why you made this switch.\n\n*   **Why teaching?** Write down the reasons you are passionate about K-12 education.\n*   **Why now?** You realized you needed a change, and you took action. That is strength.\n\nKeep these reasons visible. When external voices try to derail you, pull out your internal compass (your \"why\").\n\n---\n\nYou are 22, pursuing an education, and have a supportive partner. You are building a life that is authentic to *you*. Please try to let go of the idea that there is a single, correct timeline for marriage or children. Your timeline is the right one because it is yours.\n\n**If you need further support, I'm happy to talk through specific scenarios or help you brainstorm more responses!** How does it feel to think about using some of those boundary-setting scripts?"
