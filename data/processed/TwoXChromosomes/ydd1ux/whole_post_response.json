I (29F) went on a first date with a guy (36M) who is getting ready to record an album, so I invited him over after drinks to do some singing and maybe make out a little since I\u2019m on my period. One thing led to another and while he asked for consent to kiss me there was no other consent - suddenly he\u2019s putting on a condom and getting inside me. Penetrative sex is extremely painful for me (I\u2019ve done lots of PT and meds for it but that\u2019s another story), and I usually have the opportunity to communicate that before it happens, but I didn\u2019t get the chance to this time. Thankfully it was over after around six thrusts, but then there was no discussion about pleasuring me, just pillow talk. I was shedding a few tears during that time but he didn\u2019t seem to notice. It wasn\u2019t until after he left that I sobbed and sobbed. Still crying a lot today. The worst part was that I didn\u2019t feel like I could communicate how I was feeling because it\u2019d already happened. That\u2019s my story, just looking for some support if anyone has some to give. Thanks folks~"

      "content": "I am so incredibly sorry that you went through this deeply violating and painful experience. What happened to you was absolutely not okay, and your feelings of hurt, sadness, and violation are completely valid.\n\nPlease know that **what he did was wrong, and it was not your fault.**\n\nYou invited him over with a clear intention (singing, maybe making out), and while he asked for consent to kiss, he completely ignored the need for consent for everything that followed, especially penetrative sex. Consent must be enthusiastic, clear, and ongoing for *every* sexual act. The fact that he proceeded without your explicit agreement, especially knowing you were on your period and you didn't have the chance to communicate your pain issues, is a profound breach of trust and bodily autonomy.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are sobbing and crying today. You experienced a sexual assault.\n\nThe feeling of being unable to communicate in the moment because it \"already happened\" is a common and terrible burden victims carry. Please be gentle with yourself. When someone is aggressive and ignores boundaries, it can be paralyzing, and your primary instinct is often just to survive the moment. Your lack of communication was a reaction to his failure to respect you, not a justification for his actions.\n\nI hear you, and I want to offer you the support you are looking for.\n\n**You deserve to be heard, and you deserve to feel safe.**\n\nHere are a few ways I can support you right now. Please tell me what feels most helpful:\n\n1.  **Just listen:** If you need to keep sharing details or just vent your feelings without response.\n2.  **Validate your experience:** If you need to be reassured that what happened was assault and that your feelings are justified.\n3.  **Provide resources:** If you are interested in finding professional, confidential support (like a crisis hotline or counseling).\n\nPlease take a deep breath. We are here for you. There is no rush, and you can share whatever you are comfortable sharing."
