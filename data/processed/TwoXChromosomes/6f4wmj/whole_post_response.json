      "content": "Weight gain on birth control\n\nI was wondering if any of you have experienced this or have some advice. Every time I switch birth control I've gained about 15-20 pounds in a few months and have a very very difficult time losing that weight. First I tried multiple types of pills but I forgot to take those often. \n\nAbout ten months ago I switched to Nexaplon, which is the little implant that goes in your arm and lasts for three years. I've had no bad side effects like I used to get (I.e. Migraines, mood swings, loss of libido) except I gained 20 pounds again! This is such a hard thing for me because I really struggle with body image issues and now I'm 180 ponds with a frame that is at a healthy weight around 135-140. \n\nSince starting birth control almost four years ago I've been at least 150 pounds. Basically I'm wondering if any of you have experienced a similar issue and if you have any suggestions for how to combat this side effect. Any help is appreciated! "

      "content": "This sounds incredibly frustrating, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to deal with these unwanted side effects, especially when you've already found a method (Nexplanon) that successfully manages many of the other difficult symptoms you experienced, like migraines and mood swings. Dealing with body image issues on top of sudden, significant weight gain is a heavy burden.\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable why you are looking for advice and support.\n\nWhile I can't offer medical advice (I'm an AI, not a doctor), I can certainly provide information about similar experiences and common strategies people use when facing this challenge.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what you've shared and some things to consider:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Understanding the Weight Gain Connection\n\nYou are definitely not alone. The weight gain issue is one of the most common reasons people discontinue hormonal birth control, even though the scientific literature on the topic is mixed.\n\n**The Nexplanon (Etonogestrel) Connection:**\n\n*   Nexplanon uses a progestin hormone (etonogestrel). While many studies suggest that the actual fat mass increase on implants is minimal, many users report significant weight changes.\n*   **Appetite Changes:** The most common theory for weight gain on progestin-only methods is an increase in appetite or changes in how the body processes carbohydrates, leading to increased caloric intake.\n\nIt's important to remember that this weight gain is a **side effect of the medication**, not a reflection of your discipline or character.\n\n### 2. Strategies for Combating the Side Effect\n\nSince you have found a method that works well for preventing pregnancy and eliminating other severe side effects, the goal now is to try to manage this one remaining issue.\n\n#### A. Medical Consultation (The Most Important Step)\n\nBefore making any changes to your diet, exercise, or birth control, it is crucial to discuss this with your healthcare provider (OB-GYN or primary care doctor).\n\n1.  **Rule Out Other Causes:** Your doctor can run blood tests to ensure the weight gain isn't related to a separate underlying issue that coincidentally started around the same time you began birth control (e.g., thyroid issues, insulin resistance).\n2.  **Discuss the Hormone:** Tell your doctor specifically that you are otherwise happy with the Nexplanon but that the weight gain is unsustainable due to your body image struggles. They may have strategies, or they might suggest monitoring your weight for a few more months, as sometimes side effects level off after the first year.\n3.  **Explore Non-Hormonal Options:** If you decide the weight gain is too severe to manage, you might discuss highly effective non-hormonal options:\n    *   **Copper IUD (Paragard):** This is highly effective, lasts 10-12 years, and contains no hormones, meaning it will not affect your appetite, mood, or weight.\n\n#### B. Lifestyle Adjustments Focused on Appetite\n\nIf the weight gain is due to increased appetite, these strategies often help manage hunger signals:\n\n*   **Focus on Satiety:** Prioritize foods that make you feel full longer. This means increasing protein and fiber intake at every meal (e.g., lean meats, eggs, beans, lentils, whole grains, vegetables).\n*   **Hydration:** Sometimes the body confuses thirst signals with hunger. Ensure you are drinking adequate water throughout the day.\n*   **Mindful Eating:** Pay close attention to *why* you are eating. Are you truly hungry, or is it a craving? If you suspect the Nexplanon is increasing your baseline hunger, planning meals and snacks strictly can help override those constant signals.\n*   **Weight Training:** While cardio burns calories, building muscle through weight training can help boost your metabolism over time, making it easier for your body to manage weight.\n\n#### C. Addressing Body Image and Mental Health\n\nIt is incredibly difficult to try to lose weight when you are already struggling with body image issues. Focusing only on the number on the scale can be detrimental.\n\n*   **Focus on Health Behaviors:** Instead of focusing only on weight loss, shift your goal to increasing your strength, energy, and overall health. For example: \"I will walk for 30 minutes today\" instead of \"I must lose 5 pounds this month.\"\n*   **Therapy/Counseling:** If you are not already, speaking with a therapist or counselor who specializes in body image or eating issues can provide you with tools to cope with the distress caused by the weight gain, regardless of whether you keep the Nexplanon or not.\n\n### Summary of Next Steps\n\n1.  **Schedule a conversation with your healthcare provider.** Bring up your history of weight gain on all hormonal methods and specifically mention the impact on your mental health and body image.\n2.  **While waiting for the appointment,** focus on increasing protein/fiber and consistency in your movement routine to see if you can manage the increased appetite.\n3.  **If the Nexplanon is the only thing preventing severe migraines and mood swings,** and you cannot manage the weight gain, discuss the **Copper IUD (Paragard)** as a highly effective, non-hormonal alternative.\n\nYou have already done the hard work of finding an effective contraceptive that suits your lifestyle and manages other severe symptoms. I hope you and your doctor can find a path forward that supports both your physical and mental well-being."
