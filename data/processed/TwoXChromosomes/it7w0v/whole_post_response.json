This is my main account and I've decided I have no reason to hide. \n\nI've been with my partner for around 2 years. He's really great and makes me feel calm and loved. We are looking at getting a new place together and the topic of proposing has come up once or twice. But our relationship has felt a bit off recently, and it's ME. I've been guarded and in my own head. He says that he isn't sure what I'm thinking and can tell I'm dealing with something but figured it was due to stress from a recent surgery and the pandemic in general. \n\nBut it's because I've never shared my story of the abuse I faced in my last relationship. I've had about a million opportunities to tell him and could never get the courage or find the 'right time' but it's affecting me so much lately, I feel like I'm going to explode.\n\nMy ex would abuse me in my sleep. I researched his behaviour early on in the relationship and learned about something called sexsomnia. He was never diagnosed over the 7 years we dated but I always made the excuse that he had a 'medical condition'. I couldn't talk to anyone because I rationalized it as his business that I didn't have a right to share. I was an idiot. He was never fully conscious while he assaulted me, at least to my knowledge. I would wake up in the morning if I slept at all, to him happy and rested, seemingly unaware of what the fuck he did to me the night previous. I would share with him what he did and his usual response of \"so sorry!\" eventually turned into just straight up blaming me for him being repressed sexually, y'know what could I expect when he wasn't getting any?! (I have Endometriosis and sex is never a guarantee day to day, my pain always interfered.) It escalated over the years and by the end of our relationship just the thought of him touching me in anyway shape or form disgusted and horrified me. I cringed when him or anyone touched me. I eventually women'd up and got the fuck out of that relationship, but never took the time to heal and never looked back.\n\nI didn't think I was being abused at the time, but after working with a therapist I realized he was *never actually diagnosed*  by a medical professional. He actively and knowingly violated me for years. And blamed me for it.\n\nMy partner deserves to know before we get deeper into this. I finally texted and told him I needed to share something with him tonight so I couldn't wuss out and not say anything again. I'm freaking the actual fuck out and I don't know how to tell him. I wanted it to be in person so that if he had questions I could explain myself. If anyone has any advice or is willing to share their story, I would be eternally grateful. Thanks for reading if you took the time xo.\n\nTLDR; I want to share my sexual assult story with my partner before our relationship gets more serious."

      "content": "This is a monumental step, and I want to start by acknowledging the immense courage it takes to not only face this trauma but to decide to share it with the person you love most. You are doing the absolute right thing for yourself and for your relationship.\n\nPlease take a deep breath. It is completely understandable that you are \"freaking the actual fuck out.\" What you endured was prolonged, insidious, and accompanied by years of gaslighting and blame. You survived something horrific, and now you are taking control of your narrative.\n\nLet's focus on how to prepare for this conversation tonight.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating Your Decision\n\nYou mentioned you felt like you were \"an idiot\" for rationalizing the abuse\u2014please, release that thought. You were a victim of abuse and manipulation. Your ex actively disguised his violations and then blamed you for them. That is the behavior of an abuser, not an \"idiot.\"\n\n**Your partner deserves to know, but more importantly, *you* deserve to be fully seen and understood by him.** This guard you've been putting up is a survival mechanism, but it\u2019s exhausting. Sharing this is the key to letting the guard down and allowing your relationship to deepen.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019ve already told him you need to share something heavy means you\u2019ve already passed the hardest hurdle\u2014the commitment to speak.\n\n## 2. Preparing the Conversation Environment\n\nSince you want to do this in person, setting the scene is crucial for your comfort and safety:\n\n*   **Timing:** Make sure you have ample time. Don't start this conversation 30 minutes before bed or before he needs to leave for work. You need a window where neither of you feels rushed.\n*   **Location:** Choose a space where you feel safe and comfortable\u2014your living room sofa, your bedroom, somewhere private where you won't be interrupted.\n*   **Safety Net:** Have water, tea, or a comforting blanket nearby. If you need to pause, stand up, or hold something, you should feel free to do so.\n\n## 3. How to Start the Conversation\n\nThe key to starting is to be direct and to frame the conversation around how this past event is impacting *your present* relationship.\n\nYou don't need a perfect speech. You just need honesty.\n\n### Suggested Opening Lines:\n\nHere are a few ways you can break the ice, depending on your comfort level:\n\n**Option A (Focus on Impact):**\n> \"Thank you for sitting down with me. I love you, and I want our relationship to be built on complete honesty. There is something from my past that has been weighing heavily on me, and it's the reason why I've been guarded lately. I need to share the story of the abuse I experienced with my ex.\"\n\n**Option B (Focus on Necessity):**\n> \"I need to share something very difficult with you tonight. I\u2019ve held onto this story for too long because I was afraid, but I can't move forward with you without you knowing. I was sexually assaulted and abused for years in my last relationship.\"\n\n### What to Share (and What Not To)\n\nYou don't have to share every single detail of the assault. Share what feels necessary for him to understand the *gravity* of what happened and the *root* of your current emotional guards.\n\n*   **Focus on the Betrayal:** Explain the \"sexsomnia\" guise and how you later realized it was a purposeful, prolonged violation and that he actively blamed you. This explains why you struggled to identify it as abuse at the time and why you have trust issues now.\n*   **Connect Past to Present:** Explain clearly: \"This is why sometimes I flinch when you touch me suddenly,\" or \"This is why I struggle with intimacy sometimes.\" He will finally have the context he needs.\n*   **State Your Needs:** Before you even share the story, tell him what you need from him right now:\n    *   \"I just need you to listen, please don't interrupt.\"\n    *   \"I don't need you to fix it, I just need you to hear me.\"\n    *   \"I might cry or get angry. That's okay.\"\n\n## 4. Managing His Reaction\n\nWhen you share something this painful, your partner will likely have a strong reaction. His reaction is about **his processing of the information**, not a reflection of you.\n\n*   **Shock/Disbelief:** He might be stunned that you carried this alone for so long.\n*   **Anger:** He will probably be furious at your ex. This is protective and healthy.\n*   **Sadness/Overwhelm:** He may be sad for the pain you experienced.\n\nIf he asks questions, it is okay to say, \"I can't talk about that specific detail right now,\" or \"I need a minute.\" You are in control of the information flow.\n\n**If he is the supportive partner you believe he is, his primary response will be empathy, validation, and a desire to comfort you.** He will recognize the strength it took to tell him.\n\n## 5. After the Conversation\n\nThis will be emotionally draining. Plan for self-care afterward:\n\n*   **Give yourself space:** It's okay to ask for a hug, and it's also okay to say, \"I need to be alone now.\"\n*   **Stay connected to your therapist:** Make sure you have a session scheduled soon after, so you can process the conversation and his reaction.\n*   **Acknowledge your success:** You will have faced one of your biggest fears. Celebrate that win, even if the conversation was difficult.\n\nYou are not an idiot. You are a survivor who is actively choosing healing, honesty, and a deeper, healthier relationship. We are all rooting for you tonight. You've got this."
