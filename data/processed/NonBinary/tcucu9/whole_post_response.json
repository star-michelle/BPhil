They told me \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d want that\u201d when I told Them before as if they lives a day in my life. I\u2019m scared of getting in trouble but I want to do this because I want to live life the way I want to and not live how others want me to. It is about 50% the causes of my daily depression episodes and s word thoughts (I\u2019m not gonna do it so please don\u2019t send me the s word hotline number) and anxiety but I told my family member I wanted to shave my head because I didn\u2019t feel like doing it, which should be a valid enough reason you shouldn\u2019t have to do something you don\u2019t want to that\u2019ll not effect your life in anyway your hair doesn\u2019t pay your bills, get you to work everyday or feed your family so why is it so important to some people to force this on them? I know they only does this to me because I\u2019m AFAB and if I was AMAB they\u2019d probably buy me a razor and do it for me. I was thinking of doing it as an impulse one day but I still get anxiety thinking about it doing it and the only razor I have is a shick intuition women\u2019s razor. What should I do? I need this so much."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to start by validating everything you\u2019ve shared. The feeling of being controlled, especially over something that impacts your gender identity, mental health, and basic hygiene, is exhausting and deeply unfair.\n\nIt is completely valid that you want to shave your head for both reasons:\n1. **Gender Identity:** Shaving your head is a powerful act of affirming who you are, and it absolutely makes sense that your current hairstyle feels mismatched and contributes to dysphoria and depression.\n2. **Mental Health/Hygiene:** When depression drains your energy, basic tasks like washing hair become monumental obstacles. Removing that obstacle is a logical and necessary step in managing your mental health.\n\nYour family member telling you, \"I don't think you'd want that,\" is dismissive and invalidating. You know what you want and need, and it is frustrating to have your autonomy stripped away, especially based on outdated or gendered expectations (the AFAB vs. AMAB treatment).\n\nLet\u2019s talk through the practical steps and preparation, which might help reduce the anxiety around the impulse.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Preparation and Planning (Reducing Anxiety)\n\nWhile the impulse to just do it is strong, taking a few preparatory steps can ensure the process is smoother, safer, and less likely to result in nicks or painful tugging, which can spike anxiety.\n\n### The Tool Issue: Schick Intuition\n\nThe **Schick Intuition razor is not the right tool** for shaving a full head of hair, especially if your hair is long. It\u2019s designed for short body hair.\n\n*   **Problem:** The head is bulky, and the built-in soap/moisture bar will clog immediately with hair, making the process slow, painful, and likely to require multiple blades.\n*   **Solution: You Need Clippers First.**\n    If you want a truly smooth shave, you must get the hair down to a very short stubble first (like 1/8 inch or less).\n    *   **Recommendation:** If you can safely access them without your family noticing, buy a cheap set of electric hair clippers. They are often available for $20-$30 at drugstores or big box stores. This will be the safest and fastest way to remove the bulk of the hair.\n\n### The Shaving Process (If you get clippers):\n\n1.  **Cut the Bulk:** Use scissors or clippers (with a long guard first, then switch to the shortest guard) to get the hair as short as possible.\n2.  **Shower Prep:** Take a very warm shower. The heat softens the hair and opens the pores, reducing irritation.\n3.  **Lather Up:** Use shaving cream, shaving gel, or even hair conditioner (a thick, creamy one works well) to lubricate your scalp. Do not use the Schick Intuition soap bar alone.\n4.  **Shave:** Use the sharpest, cleanest razor you have (if you have to use the Schick, make sure the blade is new). Shave *with* the grain first (the direction the hair naturally grows), rinsing the razor frequently. Then, re-lather and shave *against* the grain for a closer, smoother finish.\n5.  **Aftercare:** Rinse with cool water (to close the pores) and apply a gentle, unscented moisturizer or aftershave balm to prevent bumps and dryness.\n\n***\n\n## 2. Addressing the Fear of Consequences\n\nIt is completely valid to be scared of getting in trouble. You are choosing your well-being over someone else's aesthetic preference, and that takes immense courage.\n\nWhen you do decide to take this step, remember the reasons why you are doing it. These reasons are not superficial; they are vital to your health.\n\n### How to Frame the Decision After the Fact:\n\nWhen your family member reacts (and they likely will), stick firmly to the facts that address their concerns, not their feelings about how you look.\n\n1.  **Mental Health/Hygiene:** \"I needed to do this because I physically cannot maintain my hair right now, and the stress of trying to keep up with washing it was making my depression episodes worse. This is a practical solution for my hygiene and mental health.\"\n2.  **Autonomy:** \"This is my body, and I needed to make a choice that supports my well-being. This is not up for discussion.\"\n3.  **Gender (Optional, if safe):** If you feel safe enough, you can mention the gender identity aspect: \"This style matches how I feel about myself, and it's essential for my happiness.\"\n\nYou have every right to live the way you want to, especially when that choice is directly linked to reducing your daily burden of depression and anxiety. This is an act of self-care and self-determination.\n\nTake a deep breath. You are prioritizing yourself, and that is a powerful thing to do. Whether you do it impulsively or after planning, know that you are making a choice that serves *you*."
