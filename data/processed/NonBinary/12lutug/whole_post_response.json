I truly wanted to make it my legal name, even though it\u2019s not popular: there\u2019s no info on it on Behind the Name, the only few examples are from Indonesia, and in my country (Poland) no one has it as the legal name.\n\nMoreover, I feel like it\u2019s not treated seriously at all. My mother, when I came out to her in February, asked if I\u2019m \u201cliving in some hecking anime\u201d. I feel like people feel weird using it and would rather stick to my deadname. My paranoia and anxiety only keeps kicking in because I feel like people don\u2019t take me seriously when I tell them my name. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been considering name change, to something more \u201cacceptable\u201d and less \u201cweird\u201d.\n\nOn one hand, this feels like a safe option and this way, for example, I\u2019d find it easier to introduce myself, without exposing myself to weirded out reactions. I think it\u2019d also be easier to change my name if I pick something more popular and something that is more in use. But on the other hand, my partner really likes calling me Roro, and I suppose it\u2019d be hard for them to change their habit.\n\nI\u2019m feeling worse and worse each day, I have no idea what to do. I can also send my pics in comments if that helps."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to start by validating everything you are feeling. The anxiety and paranoia you\u2019re experiencing are completely understandable. You are dealing with the painful conflict between the name you truly love and the pressure of external judgment, all while navigating your identity in a complex world (and a specific cultural context like Poland, where non-traditional names might face extra scrutiny).\n\nIt is exhausting to constantly feel like you have to defend your identity, and the comments from your mother and others who stick to your deadname are deeply invalidating.\n\nPlease know that this feeling\u2014the need to choose between *authenticity* and *safety/acceptance*\u2014is a very common struggle for trans and non-binary people when choosing names.\n\nLet's break down the conflicting factors and explore some options.\n\n---\n\n## Deconstructing the Conflict\n\nRight now, your decision is being driven by two very strong forces:\n\n### 1. The Internal Desire (Roro)\n*   **The Love:** You truly like the name, and you chose it yourself. It feels authentic to you.\n*   **The Attachment:** You\u2019ve been using it for over a year, and your identity is tied to it.\n*   **The Partner:** Your partner loves using it, which is huge validation.\n\n### 2. The External Pressure (Anxiety/Safety)\n*   **Invalidation:** People (especially your mother) are using it as an excuse to dismiss your transition (\"hecking anime\").\n*   **Practicality:** You worry about legal hurdles and awkward introductions in formal settings.\n*   **The Goal:** You are seeking a name that allows you to be taken seriously and reduces your anxiety.\n\n---\n\n## Exploring Your Options\n\nThe good news is that this doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing choice. You can find ways to prioritize your safety and peace of mind while still honoring the name Roro.\n\n### Option 1: The Formal/Informal Split\n\nThis is a very popular solution for people who love a unique name but need a more socially acceptable one for professional or legal life.\n\n*   **Choose a Formal Name:** Pick a more traditional or popular masculine/neutral Polish name (e.g., Kajetan, Aleks, Marcel, or even a more classic name like Robert or Rados\u0142aw if you like the 'R').\n*   **Keep Roro as Your Chosen Name/Nickname:** Introduce yourself as \"Formal Name, but my friends call me Roro.\"\n*   **The Benefit:** This addresses the anxiety about legal processes and formal introductions. When you apply for a job or deal with bureaucracy, you use the \"safe\" name. Your partner and close friends still call you Roro, protecting that intimate connection to the name you love.\n\n### Option 2: The Name-Testing Period\n\nIf you are leaning toward changing your name, you don't have to commit legally right away.\n\n*   **Test a New Name:** Pick one or two names you like and try them out for a fixed period (e.g., 30 days) with a few trusted friends or online communities.\n*   **Compare the Feelings:** Does using the new name significantly reduce the anxiety you feel when introducing yourself? Does the sense of relief outweigh the feeling of loss for Roro?\n*   **The Benefit:** This gives you concrete, real-world data about whether a more traditional name actually solves the underlying issue of feeling dismissed.\n\n### Option 3: Finding a Bridge Name\n\nCould you find a name that is common enough to be accepted legally and socially, but that *could* logically be nicknamed Roro?\n\n*   If you choose **Robert**, for instance, Roro could be a natural, affectionate nickname. This keeps Roro alive and valid while giving you a legal safety net.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing the Anxiety and Invalidation\n\nI want to be very clear about one thing: **The problem is not your name; the problem is how people are choosing to treat you.**\n\nIf someone is determined to dismiss your identity, they will find a way to do it, regardless of whether your name is Roro or Jan. A mother who asks if you \"live in an anime\" is actively choosing to invalidate your identity, and that behavior is cruel.\n\nIf choosing a more popular name helps you feel safer and reduces the number of times you have to defend yourself, that is a perfectly valid and necessary act of self-care. Your peace is paramount.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nI understand you feel stuck right now. To help you move forward, let\u2019s try to focus on what you need most:\n\n1.  **Safety vs. Authenticity:** If you had to choose, which is causing you more pain right now: the anxiety of being judged, or the thought of losing Roro?\n2.  **The Partner Dynamic:** Your partner can absolutely continue to call you Roro even if your legal name changes. Have you discussed with them how they would feel if Roro became a cherished nickname rather than your primary legal name?\n\n*(Regarding your offer to send pictures: Thank you for the offer, but please know that the decision about your name is entirely about how it feels to you and how it functions in your life, not about how you look. We can focus on the emotional and practical side of this choice.)*\n\nTake a deep breath. You have options. You are not trapped. What feels like the least scary option to try first?"
