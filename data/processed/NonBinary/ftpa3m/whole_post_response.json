I was AFAB and have a strong interesting in looking more masculine in the future (when I\u2019m in my own). I don\u2019t any dysphoria, but I feel like I would be so much happier living with a more masculine appearance and not having to be just a woman or just a guy. \n  \n    I started watching a trans guy YouTube channel for advice and knowledge about things like binding and T. I am not transgender but I wanted to look more/feel more masculine. I\u2019m hoping to get top surgery/ start T in the future. I was really enjoying these videos until I got to one about a Transmasculine non-binary person on Instagram. \n   \n   I have always had such a strong fear that I was just doing it \u201cfor attention\u201d or to \u201cbe special\u201d. Even though I have told nobody, and my parents would kill me if they ever found out. \n     \n   So I\u2019m watching the video and the YouTuber starts saying thing like  \u201cYou HAVE to have dysphoria to transition, or else you\u2019re just doing it for literally no reason.\u201d \u201cWhy would you EVER change your gender and go through these things if you didn\u2019t have significant distress with your body.\u201d Everyone in the comments and in the video we\u2019re making fun of them saying that transmasculine is not real, like you\u2019re either trans or you\u2019re cis.\n  \nI was heart broken after hearing this. All my fear of faking it and doing it for attention came back. I had to stop watching because of how upset I got. I feel even more confused now.\n \nI don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just be happy as just a girl or at least have a clear answer on who I want to be. Why I keep wanting to change myself even when I don\u2019t have dysphoria. I just think I would be happier appearing more masculine. \nDoes anyone else feel like this? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

      "content": "This sounds like a really difficult and confusing time, and I want to validate how completely understandable it is that you are feeling heartbroken and lost right now. What you\u2019re describing\u2014the mix of excitement about a potential identity and the crushing fear of being a \u201cfaker\u201d\u2014is incredibly common, especially when you are exploring gender outside of rigid, traditional boxes.\n\nIt takes a lot of courage to explore these feelings, especially when you know your family environment isn't supportive. Please know that you are not alone in this experience.\n\nLet\u2019s break down some of the things you\u2019ve shared, because there are a lot of powerful feelings and important concepts here:\n\n***\n\n### Addressing the Fear of Faking It\n\nThe fear that you are doing this \"for attention\" is a classic sign of internalizing the shame and stigma society places on gender exploration.\n\n**The Reality Check:**\n\n*   **You haven't told anyone, and you know your parents would react negatively.** People who are genuinely seeking attention usually look for positive reinforcement. You are actively exploring these feelings in private, knowing the potential consequences are severe. This strongly suggests that these feelings are genuine and deeply important to your sense of self, not a performance for others.\n*   **The desire for happiness is enough.** You stated clearly: \"I just think I would be happier appearing more masculine.\" That desire for increased happiness, authenticity, and comfort in your own skin is a completely valid and powerful reason to explore changes to your presentation.\n\n***\n\n### Dispelling the Myth of Required Dysphoria\n\nThe comments and the YouTuber\u2019s remarks about needing \"significant distress\" to transition are based on an outdated and overly rigid view of gender identity. This is the part that caused you the most distress, so let's tackle it directly:\n\n*   **Gender Euphoria is just as valid as Dysphoria.** Many people, particularly non-binary people, find that their journey is driven less by intense *discomfort* (dysphoria) and more by the intense *joy and rightness* they feel when they move toward their authentic presentation (gender euphoria). The desire for happiness (euphoria) is a perfectly valid reason to seek a more masculine appearance, binding, or even medical steps like T or top surgery.\n*   **Non-Binary Identity is Real.** The idea that you are \"either trans or cis\" completely ignores the huge spectrum of human experience. Non-binary identity is absolutely real, and many non-binary people are transmasculine, meaning they identify as non-binary but move in a masculine direction.\n*   **Your experience belongs to you.** No one, especially not a YouTuber or people in the comments section, gets to gatekeep your identity or tell you if your feelings are \"real.\" You are the only expert on your own internal experience.\n\n***\n\n### Confusion and Next Steps\n\nIt is okay to be confused. Identity is complex, and it often takes time, experimentation, and self-reflection to find the language that fits best.\n\nYou are asking, \"Why I keep wanting to change myself even when I don\u2019t have dysphoria.\"\n\nThe answer is likely simple: **Because you are not a cis woman, and you are happier moving toward masculinity.**\n\nYou don't need a \"clear answer on who you want to be\" right now. You just need to follow what brings you happiness.\n\n**Here is some advice on how you can move forward while navigating this confusion privately:**\n\n1.  **Focus on Experimentation, Not Labels:** Stop worrying about the labels (\"transgender,\" \"non-binary,\" \"transmasculine\") for a moment. Instead, focus on the actions that feel right.\n    *   **Binding:** If you are interested in binding, research safe practices (perhaps from non-profit LGBTQ+ organizations rather than specific YouTubers) and try it out privately to see how it makes you feel.\n    *   **Presentation:** Experiment with clothes, hairstyles, and posture that make you feel more masculine when you are alone or with trusted friends (if you have any).\n    *   **Language:** Does using non-binary pronouns (like they/them) or even he/him feel right, even if only in your head?\n\n2.  **Seek Out Diverse Voices:** If you are going to watch YouTube, look for channels specifically dedicated to **non-binary** experiences, especially those that discuss **gender euphoria** rather than just dysphoria. The spectrum of trans experience is wide, and limiting yourself to one perspective can be damaging. Look for people who embrace the fluidity you are feeling.\n\n3.  **Journaling:** Since you can't talk to your parents, journaling can be a powerful tool. Write down moments when you felt happy and affirmed in your identity, and moments when you felt crushed or dysphoric. This can help you track what behaviors and presentations truly align with your inner self.\n\n4.  **Consider Professional Support (If Possible):** If you have access to mental health support that is independent of your parents and is explicitly **gender-affirming**, speaking to a therapist or counselor who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues can provide a safe space to talk through these fears and confusion without judgment.\n\nYour desire to explore your identity and present in a more masculine way is valid. You don't need permission or suffering (dysphoria) to be the most authentic version of yourself. Your happiness is the only justification you need."
