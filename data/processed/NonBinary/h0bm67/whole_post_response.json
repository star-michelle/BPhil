I\u2019m an AMAB nb, I came out to most of my friends about a year ago. My friend from high school, who has been my best friend for a long time, was posting in defense of JK Rowling and basically mimicking her views on biological sex etc. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s expressed this, he knows I\u2019m nb, and basically just won\u2019t accept that it\u2019s transphobic because he \u201chold[s] no hate in his heart for trans people, but think[s] gender identity and physical sex are different.\u201d I told him he was being stubborn and ignorant and he said that he isn\u2019t sure he can be friends with someone who sees him that way. \n\nIt just sucks really bad. He and I play games together constantly and it\u2019s long been my main source of relaxation, and we\u2019ve been friends for 10 years. He made me feel like it\u2019s my fault for being so ideological or rigid, but I\u2019m really hurt by all his bullshit. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking for advice or sympathy, but I\u2019m so depressed I just don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. Sorry for the long post or if I used the wrong tag"

      "content": "I am so deeply sorry you are going through this. Please know that it is completely understandable why you are feeling confused, alone, and depressed right now.\n\nLosing a friend of ten years is devastating under any circumstances, but when that loss is tied directly to your identity and your right to exist, the pain is compounded by betrayal and invalidation.\n\nYou do not need to apologize for the length of your post or the tag\u2014this is exactly the kind of space where you should be able to share the full weight of what you are experiencing.\n\n### 1. Validate the Grief and Confusion\n\nRight now, you are experiencing a form of grief. You haven't just lost a friend; you've lost a decade of shared history, your main source of relaxation (gaming), and the foundational trust you had in someone close to you.\n\nIt is absolutely normal to feel confused when someone you love and respect tells you that your core identity is merely an \"ideology\" that they cannot accept.\n\n**You are not being rigid or ideological.** You are simply asserting your reality and setting a boundary that protects your emotional and psychological safety.\n\n### 2. Addressing the Core Conflict\n\nLet\u2019s talk specifically about the rhetoric your friend was using, because it is crucial that you understand that your reaction was justified:\n\n> *\u201cHe holds no hate in his heart for trans people, but thinks gender identity and physical sex are different.\u201d*\n\nThis statement is the textbook way that people attempt to minimize transphobic rhetoric while feeling morally good about themselves.\n\n1.  **It dismisses lived experience:** For people who are non-binary or trans, the distinction between \"gender identity\" and \"physical sex\" (as they define it) is often used to deny access, safety, or basic recognition. When someone insists on centering \"biological sex\" as essential or primary, they are inherently invalidating identities like yours.\n2.  **It is inherently ideological:** His refusal to adapt his understanding to respect your reality *is* ideological rigidity. You are not asking him to change his entire worldview, you are asking him to respect *you*. When he refuses, he is prioritizing his abstract, harmful ideology over your concrete existence and friendship.\n3.  **The blame shift is manipulative:** When he said he couldn't be friends with someone who \"sees him that way,\" he was trying to shift the blame onto you for pointing out his harmful behavior. This is a classic tactic to avoid accountability.\n\n**Your Bullshit Detector is Working:** You are right to be hurt by his \"bullshit.\" You stood up for yourself and your community. That takes courage, and it is a necessary act of self-love.\n\n### 3. What to Do and How to Feel\n\nYou asked for advice and sympathy. Here is some of both:\n\n#### Sympathy (Emotional Support)\n\n*   **Allow the Grief:** Don't try to intellectualize or minimize the sadness. A ten-year friendship ending is a massive loss. Let yourself feel the depression and the pain.\n*   **Acknowledge the Betrayal:** It hurts even more because he knew you were non-binary and chose to double down on rhetoric that actively harms you. That is a profound act of disrespect and betrayal, and you are allowed to be angry about it.\n\n#### Advice (Practical Steps)\n\n1.  **Prioritize Self-Care and Distraction:** Your main source of relaxation (gaming) is now tied up with this painful loss. You need to find replacement activities immediately.\n    *   Can you play a single-player game you\u2019ve been meaning to start?\n    *   Do you have *other* friends (even acquaintances) you could game with this week?\n    *   Can you find a temporary distraction (a new show, a book, a physical activity)?\n2.  **Journal/Process the Conflict:** Write down everything you wanted to say to him, or everything you are feeling about the conflict. Getting it out of your head can sometimes help reduce the confusion and the loop of self-blame.\n3.  **Lean on Supportive Friends:** Reach out to the friends who *did* accept you when you came out. Tell them what happened. Let them remind you that you are valued and loved for who you are.\n\nYou did not cause this. He made a choice to prioritize harmful rhetoric over a decade-long friendship. That is on him, not on you.\n\nWe are here for you. Whether you need to vent more about the specific pain, or if you want advice on how to find new gaming groups, please let me know. What kind of support would be most helpful for you right in this moment?"
