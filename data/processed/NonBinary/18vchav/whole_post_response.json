      "content": "My partner came out as non-binary and I\u2019m struggling to accept it.\n\nI\u2019m a cis female married to my partner AMAB for 4 years. When we got married they identified as a male. I grew up in a high demand religion that teaches there are only 2 genders and is quite homophobic and transphobic. 2 years in my partner came out as Bi to me then now another year later non-binary. I felt I tried to adopt their pronouns and tried to picture how this new relationship would work but in my gut feel uncomfortable with it. I feel pretty uncomfortable when they experiment with dresses and makeup and appear more feminine. But I see how happy they are and they\u2019re a new person in a good way- which makes me really happy for them. But they\u2019re also a new person. We went to counseling together and counselors said it\u2019s ok if you\u2019re straight and the relationship doesn\u2019t work for you but I\u2019m having a really hard time accepting that as truth. I\u2019ve been trying for 10 months to shake this feeling of discomfort, don\u2019t get me wrong, I could have done things a lot better but I felt like I was holding them back and hurting them because I\u2019ve had this thought that a queer relationship doesn\u2019t work for me, that now we\u2019ve been separated for about 3 weeks. I feel terrible and unsatisfied because I feel like the relationship itself didn\u2019t necessarily change and was going well.  Now I\u2019m torn. Is it possible that I can challenge myself and this \u201coff\u201d feeling, this feeling of discomfort can go away? I love my partner with all my heart but I also feel like everyone around me doesn\u2019t want me to give myself up for the relationship. Would that be considered giving up my own identity to make it work? I\u2019m just feeling really heartbroken and stuck."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult, painful, and confusing position to be in. Please, before we dive into your questions, take a deep breath and acknowledge how much emotional labor you have already expended. You are navigating a profound shift in your closest relationship while simultaneously fighting deeply ingrained beliefs from your upbringing.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are heartbroken and stuck. You are feeling the conflict between your deep love for your partner and the learned discomfort that stems from your religious background.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack your feelings and the core questions you are asking.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Validating the Source of Your Discomfort\n\nIt is crucial to recognize that the \"off\" feeling you describe is not a moral failing; it is a **learned response**.\n\nYou grew up in a high-demand religious environment that specifically taught that only two genders exist and that queer identities are wrong. This is not just a belief system; it is a framework that shapes your perception of safety, normalcy, and love. When your partner came out, they didn't just change their pronouns; they challenged the fundamental structure of reality you were taught.\n\n**When you feel discomfort seeing your partner in dresses or makeup, ask yourself:**\n\n*   Is this a feeling of **loss of attraction**? (A genuine, physical shift in what draws me to them?)\n*   Or is this a feeling of **social anxiety and fear**? (If I accept this, am I breaking rules? Am I putting myself outside the boundaries of what I was taught is \"right\"?)\n*   Is it merely **unfamiliarity**? (I have never seen the person I love look like this before, and the newness is jarring.)\n\nOften, in situations like this, the discomfort is primarily rooted in the fear of breaking deeply held, culturally enforced rules, rather than a genuine shift in core attraction to the person themselves.\n\n***\n\n## 2. Challenging the Discomfort: Can the \"Off\" Feeling Go Away?\n\nYou asked: **\"Is it possible that I can challenge myself and this 'off' feeling, this feeling of discomfort can go away?\"**\n\n**Yes, it is absolutely possible.**\n\nFeelings are not static facts; they are reactions. If the discomfort is rooted in prejudice, fear, or unfamiliarity (as is often the case when leaving restrictive belief systems), those feelings can be challenged, lessened, and replaced by acceptance over time.\n\nThis process is called **cognitive restructuring** or **deconstruction**, and it requires time and intentional effort, usually taking much longer than 10 months.\n\n### How to Challenge the Discomfort:\n\n1.  **Identify the Voice:** When you feel uncomfortable, identify where that voice is coming from. Is it *your* genuine emotional response, or is it the voice of the religious doctrine you were raised with?\n2.  **Separate the Person from the Presentation:** You noted: \"I love my partner with all my heart but I also feel like everyone around me doesn\u2019t want me to give myself up for the relationship.\" Focus on the things that *haven't* changed: their personality, their humor, the connection you share, and the fact that you still feel the relationship was going well. The visual presentation is the surface; the person underneath is who you married.\n3.  **Exposure and Normalization:** The discomfort of seeing them in makeup or dresses will likely lessen the more you are exposed to it. What feels \"strange\" or \"wrong\" today may simply feel \"normal\" in six months, because your brain adapts to new reality.\n\n***\n\n## 3. Identity and Relationship: Giving Yourself Up?\n\nYou asked: **\"Would that be considered giving up my own identity to make it work?\"**\n\nThis is the central tension the counselors touched upon, and it\u2019s where clarity is essential.\n\n### What is Identity in this Context?\n\nYour identity is multifaceted. It includes:\n\n1.  **Sexual Orientation (Straight):** If you are fundamentally attracted only to men, and your partner transitioning away from a male identity breaks that core attraction, then forcing yourself to stay would be asking you to change your sexual orientation. That is often impossible and would feel like \"giving up\" a core part of yourself.\n2.  **Values and Commitment:** Your identity also includes your capacity for love, commitment, and acceptance. If you choose to stay because your love for this specific person transcends their gender presentation, you are not \"giving up\" your identity; you are **expanding** it. You are choosing the value of love and commitment over the limitations of a label (like \"straight\"). You might shift your identity label (e.g., to pansexual, or simply remain straight but acknowledge your partner is the exception), or you might realize the relationship *is* more important than the label.\n\n### The Key Difference:\n\n*   **Giving up your identity:** Staying in a relationship where you genuinely have no attraction or emotional connection, purely out of obligation or guilt.\n*   **Challenging your identity:** Choosing to prioritize the unique, deep connection you have with your partner, even if it means letting go of the restrictive, external definition of the relationship you started with.\n\nThe fact that you are separated but feel \"unsatisfied\" because the relationship itself was going well strongly suggests that the **relationship dynamic** is healthy, but the **external label and presentation** are causing the internal conflict.\n\n***\n\n## Where to Go From Here: Steps for Clarity\n\nYou are torn between outside advice telling you it\u2019s okay to leave if you\u2019re straight, and your deep internal love for your partner.\n\nInstead of making a final decision right now, use this time of separation for focused reflection:\n\n1.  **Stop Focusing on the Labels:** For a moment, stop thinking about \"straight,\" \"non-binary,\" \"husband,\" or \"wife.\" Focus solely on the emotional bond. If your partner looked exactly the same as they do now, but you had never had the religious background\u2014would you still be pulled to them?\n2.  **Individual Therapy:** While couples counseling was helpful, it sounds like you need dedicated individual support to work through the religious deconstruction and internalized transphobia. A therapist specializing in religious trauma or LGBTQ+ issues can help you safely dismantle the beliefs causing the discomfort without judgment.\n3.  **Define Your Needs:** What do you need to feel comfortable? Is it time? Is it a clear boundary on expression (e.g., feeling uncomfortable with certain public presentations)? You need to understand what specific elements are causing distress so you can articulate them\u2014not to control your partner, but to understand your own limits.\n4.  **Accept the Grief:** You are grieving the loss of the relationship you *thought* you had\u2014the cis-hetero marriage. You must allow yourself to mourn that reality before you can fully embrace the new one. This grief is valid, regardless of whether you ultimately stay or go.\n\nYou are not a bad person for struggling with this. You are a person caught between a lifetime of rigid instruction and the overwhelming power of love. The choice is yours, but it should be made from a place of clarity about *who* you are choosing, not fear about *what* the relationship looks like to the outside world."
