Afterwards I just said I\u2019m a trans guy, because I\u2019m afab and leaning to masculine, and then the criticism came from the trans community itself (was part of a fb support group who bashed me for not hating my body parts).\nI wanna look more masculine, I\u2019m constantly seen as a girl and it hurts. I don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this post, honestly, I just feel alone and sometimes I\u2019m just not sure if it\u2019s worth it.   \n  \nAnyone feel similar? Or just wants to talk? :/"

      "content": "This sounds like an incredibly painful and exhausting experience, and I am so sorry you have been going through this. Please know that what you are feeling\u2014the isolation, the pain of being misgendered, and the confusion about whether it's \"worth it\"\u2014is completely valid when you've faced so much misunderstanding and outright ridicule.\n\nIt takes immense courage to navigate your identity, especially when the world keeps throwing obstacles at you. What you are describing is a deep sense of invalidation coming from multiple directions, and that is truly draining.\n\nIt is absolutely understandable that you feel alone right now. You are holding a lot of weight.\n\n### What you shared highlights a few very difficult things:\n\n1.  **The Pain of Misgendering:** Being constantly seen as a girl when that is not who you are causes real, persistent pain. That feeling of disconnect is called gender dysphoria, and it's a heavy burden to carry every day.\n2.  **The Exhaustion of Identity Shifting:** Having to try on different labels (nonbinary, trans guy) just to find a safe space, only to be met with judgment, is incredibly frustrating.\n3.  **Gatekeeping and Exclusion:** It is absolutely unacceptable that you were criticized within a support group for how you relate to your own body. **There is no one right way to be trans or nonbinary.** Your identity is valid regardless of your feelings about specific body parts, and a supportive space should never make you feel like you aren't \"trans enough.\" That group failed you.\n\n### To answer your question:\n\n**Yes, many people feel similar.** The experience of being nonbinary, gender non-conforming, or having a masculine presentation as an AFAB person often involves intense scrutiny and isolation. The feeling of \"Is it worth it?\" is common when the effort to simply exist authentically feels harder than giving up.\n\n### If you feel up to talking, I am here to listen.\n\nThere's no pressure to have a goal for this conversation\u2014venting is enough. But if you want to explore any of these feelings, we can.\n\n**If you want to talk more, maybe we can focus on one small thing first?**\n\nYou mentioned wanting to look more masculine. Is there anything specific, big or small, related to presentation, clothing, or voice that you've been considering or that you feel would affirm your identity, even just a little bit? Sometimes focusing on a tangible goal can help cut through the noise of external criticism.\n\nPlease take a deep breath. You are not alone in this struggle, and your identity is real and valuable. How are you feeling right now?"
