I also feel like I've had an incredibly present feminine side that I love about myself. I'm very self conscious about expressing it though because of how much unwanted attention it usually gets (for instance, I really like the way I look with more feminine styled clothes/earrings/etc). Most of the unwanted attention is usually pretty harmless but leaves me feeling like I have to explain myself.  And here's the thing - I just don't even know where to begin so I do whats easy and just conform to presenting as male.\n\nFor most of my life I didn't really know much about issues surrounding gender and sexuality.  I have a penis and *mostly* like women which seemed pretty normal and expected of me, so I just never questioned my identity beyond straight-male. I didn't know I could be anything other than \"straight-male\" or \"gay-male\" or \"trans-women\".  Out of the three, straight-male seemed to fit the best, but definitely not a perfect fit... Growing up, there was always people reminding me to not wear certain things because \"those are for girls/women\", or making comments about how \"I'm sexually male, but intellectually female\" (whatever that even means).       \n\nThere's things I genuinely like about being male, but I feel like presenting completely as male paints an incomplete portrait of who I am in my heart.  I find myself wishing the people around me would just reject my gender completely but don't know how to even begin asking that of people who have known me my whole life. How do I ask my partner to do that after being together for 10 years? I don't want people to see me as a woman, because I'm not, but I also don't feel like I always relate to being a man.  \n\nI guess my question is - am I non binary if I mostly want to reject gender identity but still embrace things I like about my assigned at birth gender? Can I be born male and use they/he pronouns? Is gender even real?\n\ntl;dr not sure if I'm nonbinary or just a guy with feminine thoughts... or maybe we're all just people? Any advice or wisdom would be appreciated."

      "content": "This is a wonderful, thoughtful post, and I want to start by validating everything you have shared. The feelings you are describing\u2014the sense of incompleteness, the fear of unwanted attention, the realization that the binary labels don't quite fit\u2014are incredibly common, especially for people who are coming to these realizations later in life.\n\nIt takes immense courage to look inward and start questioning the assumptions you\u2019ve held about yourself for decades. Please know that you are in a safe space here.\n\nLet's unpack your experiences and questions one by one.\n\n***\n\n## 1. The Experience of Late Realization\n\n> Has anyone here ever had the experience of NOT always knowing they were non-binary?\n\n**Absolutely, yes.** This is an extremely common experience, often referred to as \"late-blooming\" or simply a \"later realization.\"\n\nFor people over 30, especially those assigned male at birth (AMAB), the lack of visibility and language around non-binary identities meant that the only options presented were often \"man,\" \"woman,\" or \"gay.\" If you didn't fit neatly into those categories, the default was often to suppress the feelings or categorize them simply as being a \"sensitive man\" or \"just a guy with feminine thoughts.\"\n\nThe fact that you are exploring this now simply means you have reached a point of self-awareness and have found the language necessary to describe the feelings you\u2019ve likely had all along. It is never too late to understand your gender identity.\n\n## 2. Addressing Your Core Questions\n\nYour post contains several key questions about identity, expression, and labels.\n\n### \"Am I non-binary if I mostly want to reject gender identity but still embrace things I like about my assigned at birth gender?\"\n\nYes, absolutely. This is a crucial point:\n\n1.  **Non-Binary is Not the Opposite of Your Assigned Gender:** Being non-binary (NB) means your gender identity is not *exclusively* male or *exclusively* female. It is an umbrella term that includes identities like genderfluid, agender, demigender, genderqueer, etc.\n2.  **Gender Identity vs. Gender Expression:** You can be non-binary and still enjoy aspects of masculinity (your comfort with certain \"male\" traits, your penis, etc.). Your *identity* (who you are in your heart) is separate from your *expression* (how you dress or present). Many non-binary people continue to present in ways that are traditionally associated with their assigned gender, either for comfort, safety, or simply because they like those clothes or styles.\n3.  **The Key Indicator:** The strongest signal that you might be non-binary is the feeling that **\"presenting completely as male paints an incomplete portrait of who I am in my heart\"** and that you **\"don't feel like I always relate to being a man.\"** If the label \"man\" doesn't fully capture your inner experience, you are, by definition, outside the binary.\n\n### \"Can I be born male and use they/he pronouns?\"\n\nYes, absolutely. Pronouns are a communication tool, not a full summary of your identity.\n\n*   Many non-binary individuals use mixed pronoun sets (like they/he, or he/they). This can be a way to honor the masculine side you enjoy while also communicating that you exist outside the binary.\n*   The choice of pronouns is entirely yours, and they can change over time as you explore.\n\n### \"Is gender even real?\"\n\nThis is a philosophical question that many non-binary people wrestle with!\n\nThe consensus in gender studies is that **gender is a social construct.** The rules, roles, and expectations associated with \"man\" or \"woman\" are created by culture and society.\n\nHowever, your **gender identity**\u2014your deeply held, internal sense of self\u2014is very real. The feeling you have that you are neither exclusively a man nor a woman, and the desire to reject the rigidity of those boxes, is a very common perspective for people who identify as agender (lacking gender) or genderqueer (rejecting traditional gender norms). Your feeling that \"we're all just people\" is often the ultimate conclusion of non-binary identity.\n\n### \"Am I nonbinary or just a guy with feminine thoughts?\"\n\nThis is the central question of your exploration.\n\n*   **Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) Man:** A man who is GNC still identifies 100% as a man, but he enjoys things traditionally associated with femininity (clothes, makeup, emotional expression). He is comfortable with the label \"man.\"\n*   **Non-Binary Person:** A person who is NB does *not* identify 100% as a man (or woman). Even if they present masculinely, the internal sense of self is something other than \"exclusively man.\"\n\nBased on your statement that you **\"don't feel like I always relate to being a man\"** and your wish for people to **\"just reject my gender completely,\"** it sounds like you are leaning heavily toward a non-binary identity.\n\n## 3. Navigating Relationships and Expression\n\nThis is often the hardest part\u2014figuring out how to integrate this new understanding with people who have known you one way for a long time.\n\n### Starting the Conversation with Your Partner\n\nA 10-year relationship means you have a history, and your partner may need time and explanation. You do not have to have all the answers or a perfect label ready.\n\n**Focus on feelings and experimentation, not immediate labels:**\n\n1.  **Start with \"I\" statements about feelings:** \"I need to talk to you about something I've been exploring within myself. For a long time, I've felt that the label 'man' doesn't fully describe me, and I feel incomplete when I have to suppress my feminine side.\"\n2.  **Focus on Expression First:** Instead of asking them to instantly change pronouns, ask for safety to explore. \"I want to start wearing [feminine styled clothes/earrings] more often, especially when we are alone or in safe spaces. I need your support in allowing me to express this part of myself without judgment.\"\n3.  **Try out Pronouns Privately:** Ask your partner to try using they/he pronouns for you privately for a week. See how it feels. This takes the pressure off public presentation while allowing you to test the language.\n4.  **Reassure the Relationship:** Make it clear that this exploration is about *your identity* and not a rejection of the life you have built together.\n\n### The Desire to Reject Gender\n\nYour desire to have people \"just reject my gender completely\" is a very powerful indicator of feeling **agender** (a lack of gender identity) or **genderqueer** (an identity that exists outside, or challenges, the gender binary).\n\nYou can communicate this to people by saying: \"I am trying to move away from binary labels. I would prefer if you used [your chosen pronouns], and please know that I am not trying to be a woman, I am just trying to be more completely myself.\"\n\n***\n\n## Next Steps for Exploration\n\n1.  **Try on the Labels:** Spend some time quietly using terms like \"non-binary,\" \"genderqueer,\" or \"demigender\" (someone who partially, but not wholly, identifies with a gender) in your own head. See which one sparks a feeling of \"yes, that's it.\"\n2.  **Experiment with Pronouns:** Try they/he pronouns. How does it feel when you read them? How does it feel when you hear them?\n3.  **Find Community:** Seek out online communities (like Reddit\u2019s r/nonbinary, r/latebloomergender, or r/ftm_nb) where you can read stories from other people assigned male at birth who discovered their non-binary identity later in life. This exposure can be incredibly validating.\n4.  **Consider Therapy:** If possible, look for a therapist who specializes in gender identity. They can provide a safe, neutral space to process these feelings and help you decide which path feels most authentic.\n\nThe wisdom here is this: **You get to define yourself.** You do not need society's permission to be both masculine and feminine, to use mixed pronouns, or to discard the binary labels that feel restrictive. You are discovering the full portrait of who you are, and that is a beautiful process."
