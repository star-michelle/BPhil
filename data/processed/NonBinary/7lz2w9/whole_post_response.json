I wanna stop T or at least go on a super low dose. But I'm holding off because I need to make a decision apropos of my eventual hysterectomy.\n\nBut just the thought of becoming MORE masculine is panic inducing in me and triggers intense dysphoria. I almost don't want to go outside because I'm afraid I'm too much of a man. I'm not a man I just kinda look like one and in filled with fear that I'm going to be on it too long and be too far transitioned."

      "content": "It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time right now, navigating how you feel about your transition progress and the decisions you still need to make. It's completely understandable that you're experiencing anxiety and dysphoria when thinking about further masculinization, especially since you are already happy with many of the changes you've experienced.\n\nIt's actually quite common for non-binary people on HRT to reach a point where they feel they have achieved the changes they wanted, and then need to adjust their regimen or stop to maintain that desired balance.\n\nLet's break down what you're dealing with:\n\n### 1. The Immediate Concern: Dysphoria and Masculinization\n\nYou are 1.5 years on T and are experiencing intense dysphoria triggered by the fear of becoming \"too masculine\" or being perceived as \"too much of a man.\"\n\n*   **You have the power to stop or adjust your dose now.** If the thought of continuing on your current dose is causing panic and making you want to stay inside, that is a strong indicator that you need to prioritize your mental well-being and current comfort level.\n*   **Action Step:** You mentioned wanting to stop T or go on a super low dose. This is absolutely an option you can pursue immediately with your prescribing doctor or HRT provider. Adjusting your dose can slow down or halt further changes while you sort out the long-term decisions.\n\n### 2. The Long-Term Decision: Hysterectomy and T\n\nYou mentioned you are holding off on adjusting your T dose because you need to make a decision about an eventual hysterectomy.\n\nIt's important to clarify the connection you see between these two decisions, as they are often treated separately:\n\n*   **Why does the decision about your hysterectomy affect your current T dosage?** Are you concerned about changes that might occur if you stop T (like the return of menstrual cycles), or are there surgical requirements (like needing to be on T for a specific time period before the surgery)?\n\nIf the primary reason you are staying on T is to suppress your cycle, a very low dose of T can often maintain cycle suppression without causing significant additional masculinization. Alternatively, some people use other methods (like progesterone) to manage cycles while stopping T entirely.\n\n### 3. Validation and Support\n\nYou are not alone in feeling this way. Many non-binary individuals carefully navigate HRT:\n\n*   **\"T-Pausing\" or \"Microdosing\"** are common strategies used by NBs to achieve specific changes and then maintain them without going further. Your feelings are valid, and this is a recognized part of the non-binary transition journey.\n*   **Your identity is not defined by your appearance.** It is painful to feel misgendered or pressured into a binary box, but remember that your identity as non-binary is real, regardless of how others perceive you.\n\n**What would be the most helpful thing for you to focus on right now?**\n\n1.  **Addressing the immediate panic** by adjusting your T dose?\n2.  **Getting clarity** on how your T dose and hysterectomy decision are connected?\n\nIf you can tell me more about why you feel you need to stay on T until the hysterectomy decision is made, we can explore options that might help you manage both concerns simultaneously."
