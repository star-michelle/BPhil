I HATE my birth name and I have expressed this to my parents, at first in the softest way possible. I have been kind and forgiving about coming out, but my family has stated that they flat out refuse to use my name and pronouns. They have called me \"mentally ill\", blamed my age for \"making me want to cope with trauma by changing my name\". They basically think it's a coping strategy, something the internet has convinced me to do, etc. It is so hurtful and annoying and honestly I don't even want to see them anymore. They deadname me and use the wrong pronouns. When I came out, my father told me I would have to \"choose between my bullshit name\" or essentially \"reject my mother and abandon the relationship completely\". Basically they gave me two choices: continue to use my deadname, or reject my family and use my new name. I was accused of being abusive and selfish for \"rejecting the name they spent so much time choosing\". They accused me of rejecting my family as well. It just honestly sucks. I feel like a jerk for continuing to use my preferred name, they've even told me that if they hear others referring to me as my preferred name, they will take all of my belongings away. Am I a jerk for insisting that others use my pronouns? Should I be more forgiving to my parents?"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly painful, frustrating, and exhausting. Thank you for sharing such a difficult experience and for reaching out for support.\n\nFirst, I want to be absolutely clear about something: **You are not a jerk for insisting that others use your name and pronouns.**\n\nYour name and pronouns are fundamental parts of who you are. Respecting them is a basic form of human dignity and respect. You are not asking for a favor; you are asking to be seen and acknowledged accurately.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling hurt, annoyed, and even pushed away from your family. Let's unpack some of the things you've shared:\n\n### Addressing Your Parents' Claims\n\nThe way your parents are reacting\u2014calling you \"abusive,\" \"selfish,\" \"mentally ill,\" and accusing you of rejecting them\u2014is a common tactic used to manipulate and control someone when they are unwilling to accept a change.\n\n1.  **\"Abusive\" or \"Insulting\" Them:** Changing your name is not abusive. It is an act of self-definition. Their claim that you are being abusive for rejecting the name they chose is an emotional manipulation that centers their feelings over your identity and well-being. They are framing your need for self-respect as an attack on them.\n2.  **\"Rejecting the name they spent so much time choosing\":** While it\u2019s true they chose the name, that choice ended when you grew up and discovered who you are. The name belongs to *you*, not to them, and you have the right to change it to one that fits.\n3.  **The Ultimatum (\"Choose between your bullshit name or reject your mother\"):** This is a classic, high-pressure tactic designed to guilt you into compliance. Healthy relationships do not involve forcing someone to choose between their authentic self and their family connection. This ultimatum is the abusive act, not your name change.\n4.  **Blaming the Internet/Coping Strategy:** Dismissing your identity as a temporary phase, a mental illness, or a coping mechanism is a way for them to avoid the reality that they have a transgender son. It invalidates your lived experience entirely.\n\n### On Forgiveness and Boundaries\n\nYou asked if you should be more forgiving. Forgiveness is something you decide on for your own peace, but it should not be confused with abandoning your identity or accepting mistreatment.\n\n*   **You have already been kind and forgiving.** You expressed your identity \"in the softest way possible\" and gave them time. Their refusal to respect you despite this kindness is on them, not you.\n*   **Forgiving someone does not mean allowing them to continue hurting you.** It is perfectly acceptable and necessary to set firm boundaries to protect yourself.\n\nYour parents are actively threatening you (taking away your belongings) and emotionally blackmailing you (the ultimatum) to force you back into a role that is painful for you.\n\n### What You Can Do Now\n\nIt sounds like you are in a very difficult and potentially unsafe living situation due to their threats.\n\n1.  **Prioritize Your Safety:** If you are reliant on them for housing or financial support, you may need to carefully consider how you interact with them to minimize danger. Their threat to take away your belongings is serious.\n2.  **Set Firm Boundaries (Even if they don't respect them):** You have the right to limit contact, leave conversations, or end visits when they deadname you or use the wrong pronouns. For example: \"Dad, I need to leave now because you continue to use the wrong name. We can try talking again when you are ready to use my name, [Preferred Name].\"\n3.  **Seek Outside Support:** It is crucial to have people in your life who see you and respect you. Lean on friends, extended family members who are supportive, or community organizations.\n    *   Are there any supportive friends or teachers you can talk to?\n    *   If you are under 25, organizations like The Trevor Project or local LGBTQ+ centers can offer crisis support and resources.\n4.  **Validate Your Own Feelings:** Your feelings of hurt, anger, and annoyance are completely valid. What they are doing *sucks*. You are not a jerk; you are a person fighting for the right to exist authentically.\n\nPlease remember that you deserve to be respected, and your identity is real, valid, and not up for debate or negotiation. How are you feeling right now after writing this all out?"
