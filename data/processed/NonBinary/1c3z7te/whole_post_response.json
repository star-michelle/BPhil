And it fucking sucks.\n\nNothing except casual everyday clothes make me feel good or completely like myself. I never know what the hell to wear to a fancier event, because both a full dress and a full suit make me feel extremely dysphoric. Anything remotely feminine or masculine makes me feel like shit, but there's really no in-between that I've found.\n\nI'm afab and have pretty big boobs that also make me super dysphoric, and I'm looking to get top surgery. However, recently I got another fear \u2014 what if a permanent flat chest also makes me dysphoric because its too masculine? I bind pretty much every day, but this fear has definitely risen to the top of my mind lately.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to just live my life forever never feeling completely like myself? Honestly I wish I was just either transmasc or transfem so I'd have at least some sort of direction and goals I'd want with my transition (Not trying to dismiss their struggles of course, I know it's hard for you too). I honestly can't really see much of a happy, fully transitioned future for myself like this.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences? What am I supposed to do about this?\n\n"

      "content": "I hear how incredibly frustrating and painful this is. Feeling stuck between two extremes\u2014masculine and feminine\u2014when you know your true identity lies in the middle is exhausting, and it makes perfect sense why you feel like it \"sucks\" and why you wish the path were clearer.\n\nPlease know that you are absolutely not alone in this experience. Many non-binary people who aim for androgyny face these exact hurdles because society and fashion are built on binaries. Your desire for equilibrium and your struggle to find it are completely valid.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the two major areas you\u2019ve highlighted: formal wear and the fear around top surgery.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Navigating Androgynous Formal Wear\n\nYou are right that both a full dress and a full suit can feel intensely dysphoric when you are aiming for true androgyny. The key to formal androgynous wear is often **mixing separates** and focusing on **texture and silhouette** over traditional gendered cuts.\n\nHere are some ideas and strategies for formal events:\n\n### The \"In-Between\" Look\n\nInstead of choosing a suit (masculine) or a dress (feminine), focus on outfits that borrow elements from both or use completely neutral silhouettes:\n\n| Element | Androgynous Approach | Why it Works |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Bottoms** | Tailored, wide-leg trousers (high-waisted or palazzo cut), or a well-cut jumpsuit. | Trousers offer structure, but a wide leg can soften the silhouette, avoiding the rigidity of a traditional men's suit pant. |\n| **Tops/Layering** | A waistcoat (vest) worn over a tailored button-down shirt (silk or linen), or a well-fitting turtleneck. | A waistcoat provides structure and formality without the bulk or strong shoulders of a full blazer. A high-quality fabric shirt (like silk) can feel luxurious without being feminine. |\n| **The Jacket** | Skip the traditional blazer. If you need a jacket, try a cropped jacket, a velvet bomber, or a dramatic cape/duster coat. | These options provide formality and flair without the strong, masculine shoulder padding of a suit jacket. |\n| **Shoes** | Loafers, polished oxfords, or block-heeled boots. | These are classic, structured shoes that are not strictly feminine or masculine. |\n| **Accessories** | A subtle tie (like a skinny knit tie), a pocket square, or unique, architectural jewelry (large, modern rings or bracelets). | Accessories allow you to personalize the look and pull focus away from gendered clothing cues. |\n\n### The Jumpsuit Solution\n\nA tailored jumpsuit in a high-quality fabric (like velvet, silk, or a heavy crepe) can be an excellent choice. Jumpsuits inherently blur the lines\u2014they have the coverage of pants but the single-piece fluidity of a dress. Look for cuts that have a defined waist but loose legs.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Fear of Top Surgery Being \"Too Masculine\"\n\nThis is a profoundly important fear, and it is crucial that you acknowledge it now, before you commit to surgery. This fear shows that your goal is not *masculinity* but **body neutrality/androgyny**.\n\n### Binding vs. Surgical Results\n\nIt\u2019s important to distinguish between how binding feels and how a surgical result looks and feels:\n\n1.  **Binding is extreme compression:** It flattens everything, which can feel rigid and sometimes too square or masculine.\n2.  **Top surgery creates contour:** A good surgeon aims to create a contour that matches your desired chest shape. For non-binary people, this is often *not* the traditional male contour.\n\n### What You Can Do About This Fear\n\nWhen you eventually consult with surgeons (which you should do extensively):\n\n*   **Be Explicit About Your Goals:** Tell the surgeon, \"I am non-binary, and my goal is an androgynous chest, not a strictly masculine one.\"\n*   **Discuss Nipple Placement and Size:** Traditional male chest surgery places the nipples in a specific location. You can discuss having them placed more centrally, smaller, or potentially even opting for no nipples, depending on what makes you feel most neutral.\n*   **Look for Non-Binary Specialists:** Seek out surgeons who have experience providing non-binary and androgynous results, not just binary transmasculine results. They will understand the nuance of creating a result that is flat but not necessarily \"male.\"\n\nYou have every right to pursue a permanent body modification that makes you feel **less dysphoric** without fearing that it will create a new source of dysphoria. This is a conversation you need to have with your medical team.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Finding Direction in an Androgynous Transition\n\nThe feeling that you lack direction because you aren't strictly transmasc or transfem is common. It feels isolating because binary paths have more established blueprints (HRT protocols, common surgeries, social scripts).\n\n**Your path is not lacking direction; it simply requires you to write the map yourself.**\n\n*   **Androgyny is a Goal:** Your goal *is* direction. Your goal is to find the perfect point of equilibrium where gender markers are minimized or blended. This is a powerful, specific goal.\n*   **Focus on Reduction and Neutrality:** Your transition goals can be defined by what you want to *reduce* (dysphoria from breasts, dysphoria from high-femme presentation) and what you want to *achieve* (a neutral canvas, clothing freedom).\n*   **Experimentation is Key:** Since there\u2019s no blueprint, you have to try things out:\n    *   Try different styles of haircuts (short on the sides, but length on top; or asymmetrical cuts).\n    *   Try small amounts of makeup (e.g., filling in eyebrows for structure) while wearing masculine clothes, or vice-versa.\n    *   If you consider HRT in the future, remember that low-dose testosterone, for example, can be used to achieve vocal changes or minor fat redistribution without aiming for a fully masculine presentation.\n\n### What to Do Next\n\n1.  **Seek Non-Binary Community Spaces:** Look for forums, subreddits (like r/NonBinary or non-binary fashion groups), or local groups where others discuss their androgynous journeys. Seeing how others navigate this can provide ideas and comfort.\n2.  **Try a Stylist/Tailor (If Possible):** If you have the means, a tailor or stylist specializing in gender-neutral clothing can help you create those formal looks that feel balanced and tailored to your body.\n3.  **Talk to a Gender-Affirming Therapist:** A therapist can help you articulate these complex fears about top surgery and help you develop language to communicate your specific androgynous goals to medical professionals.\n\nYou don't have to live forever feeling this way. Transitioning as a non-binary person focused on androgyny takes courage and creativity, but it is absolutely possible to find a happy, fully transitioned future where you feel completely like yourself."
