    "body":"First time posting here but I\u2019ve just been really struggling with this. I\u2019m an AMAB nb, I came out to most of my friends about a year ago. My friend from high school, who has been my best friend for a long time, was posting in defense of JK Rowling and basically mimicking her views on biological sex etc. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s expressed this, he knows I\u2019m nb, and basically just won\u2019t accept that it\u2019s transphobic because he \u201chold[s] no hate in his heart for trans people, but think[s] gender identity and physical sex are different.\u201d I told him he was being stubborn and ignorant and he said that he isn\u2019t sure he can be friends with someone who sees him that way. \n\nIt just sucks really bad. He and I play games together constantly and it\u2019s long been my main source of relaxation, and we\u2019ve been friends for 10 years. He made me feel like it\u2019s my fault for being so ideological or rigid, but I\u2019m really hurt by all his bullshit. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking for advice or sympathy, but I\u2019m so depressed I just don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. Sorry for the long post or if I used the wrong tag"

    "title":"Am I non-binary?",
    "body":"I'm 28, assigned female at birth, and never had a problem with that. I was raised in a very religious town, and I had barely heard the word \"gay\" before high school. I'd certainly never heard of trans, non-binary, or any other gender identity. Then my best friend came out as trans when we were in our early twenties, and I started reading up on it. I brought up to my boyfriend (now fianc\u00e9) that I thought I might be agender. He essentially laughed and said \"no, you're not\".\n\nI put it away. I was happy with my body. I was happy presenting as female, though tomboy-ish. I still am. But lately, I've been feeling extremely uncomfortable with the word \"woman\". I don't know how to explain it, other than that it feels wrong. It doesn't feel like me. But female pronouns feel okay, which just makes me more confused.\n\nI'm looking for some insight, I guess. How did you know you were non-binary? What does it feel like for you? Does my experience make sense?"

    "body":"Kind of a rant, I'm afab and go by he\/him and a different name than my birth name. I HATE my birth name and I have expressed this to my parents, at first in the softest way possible. I have been kind and forgiving about coming out, but my family has stated that they flat out refuse to use my name and pronouns. They have called me \"mentally ill\", blamed my age for \"making me want to cope with trauma by changing my name\". They basically think it's a coping strategy, something the internet has convinced me to do, etc. It is so hurtful and annoying and honestly I don't even want to see them anymore. They deadname me and use the wrong pronouns. When I came out, my father told me I would have to \"choose between my bullshit name\" or essentially \"reject my mother and abandon the relationship completely\". Basically they gave me two choices: continue to use my deadname, or reject my family and use my new name. I was accused of being abusive and selfish for \"rejecting the name they spent so much time choosing\". They accused me of rejecting my family as well. It just honestly sucks. I feel like a jerk for continuing to use my preferred name, they've even told me that if they hear others referring to me as my preferred name, they will take all of my belongings away. Am I a jerk for insisting that others use my pronouns? Should I be more forgiving to my parents?"

    "body":"(transmasc enby, he\/they)\n\nI\u2019ve been using Roro as my name for over a year (initially it was just a nickname I used on the internet but I liked it too much). I truly wanted to make it my legal name, even though it\u2019s not popular: there\u2019s no info on it on Behind the Name, the only few examples are from Indonesia, and in my country (Poland) no one has it as the legal name.\n\nMoreover, I feel like it\u2019s not treated seriously at all. My mother, when I came out to her in February, asked if I\u2019m \u201cliving in some hecking anime\u201d. I feel like people feel weird using it and would rather stick to my deadname. My paranoia and anxiety only keeps kicking in because I feel like people don\u2019t take me seriously when I tell them my name. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been considering name change, to something more \u201cacceptable\u201d and less \u201cweird\u201d.\n\nOn one hand, this feels like a safe option and this way, for example, I\u2019d find it easier to introduce myself, without exposing myself to weirded out reactions. I think it\u2019d also be easier to change my name if I pick something more popular and something that is more in use. But on the other hand, my partner really likes calling me Roro, and I suppose it\u2019d be hard for them to change their habit.\n\nI\u2019m feeling worse and worse each day, I have no idea what to do.

    "body":"I'm not really sure where to start with this question... \n\nI'm over 30 years old and have, for the most part, always been comfortable with my assigned at birth gender (m).  I also feel like I've had an incredibly present feminine side that I love about myself. I'm very self conscious about expressing it though because of how much unwanted attention it usually gets (for instance, I really like the way I look with more feminine styled clothes\/earrings\/etc). Most of the unwanted attention is usually pretty harmless but leaves me feeling like I have to explain myself.  And here's the thing - I just don't even know where to begin so I do whats easy and just conform to presenting as male.\n\nFor most of my life I didn't really know much about issues surrounding gender and sexuality.  I have a penis and *mostly* like women which seemed pretty normal and expected of me, so I just never questioned my identity beyond straight-male. I didn't know I could be anything other than \"straight-male\" or \"gay-male\" or \"trans-women\".  Out of the three, straight-male seemed to fit the best, but definitely not a perfect fit... Growing up, there was always people reminding me to not wear certain things because \"those are for girls\/women\", or making comments about how \"I'm sexually male, but intellectually female\" (whatever that even means).       \n\nThere's things I genuinely like about being male, but I feel like presenting completely as male paints an incomplete portrait of who I am in my heart.  I find myself wishing the people around me would just reject my gender completely but don't know how to even begin asking that of people who have known me my whole life. How do I ask my partner to do that after being together for 10 years? I don't want people to see me as a woman, because I'm not, but I also don't feel like I always relate to being a man.  \n\nI guess my question is - am I non binary if I mostly want to reject gender identity but still embrace things I like about my assigned at birth gender? Can I be born male and use they\/he pronouns? Is gender even real?\n\ntl;dr not sure if I'm nonbinary or just a guy with feminine thoughts... or maybe we're all just people? Any advice or wisdom would be appreciated."

I was AFAB and have a strong interesting in looking more masculine in the future (when I\u2019m in my own). I don\u2019t any dysphoria, but I feel like I would be so much happier living with a more masculine appearance and not having to be just a woman or just a guy. \n  \n    I started watching a trans guy YouTube channel for advice and knowledge about things like binding and T. I am not transgender but I wanted to look more\/feel more masculine. I\u2019m hoping to get top surgery\/ start T in the future. I was really enjoying these videos until I got to one about a Transmasculine non-binary person on Instagram. \n   \n   I have always had such a strong fear that I was just doing it \u201cfor attention\u201d or to \u201cbe special\u201d. Even though I have told nobody, and my parents would kill me if they ever found out. \n     \n   So I\u2019m watching the video and the YouTuber starts saying thing like  \u201cYou HAVE to have dysphoria to transition, or else you\u2019re just doing it for literally no reason.\u201d \u201cWhy would you EVER change your gender and go through these things if you didn\u2019t have significant distress with your body.\u201d Everyone in the comments and in the video we\u2019re making fun of them saying that transmasculine is not real, like you\u2019re either trans or you\u2019re cis.\n  \nI was heart broken after hearing this. All my fear of faking it and doing it for attention came back. I had to stop watching because of how upset I got. I feel even more confused now.\n \nI don\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t just be happy as just a girl or at least have a clear answer on who I want to be. Why I keep wanting to change myself even when I don\u2019t have dysphoria. I just think I would be happier appearing more masculine. \nDoes anyone else feel like this?

    "body":"I live in New York City and my family lives upstate. I\u2019m currently having a hard time deciding whether to stay here or go, since we might be enacting essentially a lockdown of the city. Our state governor is currently against that idea, but that also might change at any time.\n\nI live independently in my own apartment as a grad student. I don\u2019t mind being here by myself. I\u2019m actually enjoying it, really. I\u2019m allowed to work from home and have been doing so, so I have a steady income so far.\n\nI\u2019d feel horrible if I decide to stay here and not go though. My mom worries a lot, and I know she\u2019d want me to go stay with her and my family.  I love my mom and my sisters and I do miss them and I know they miss me too. Problem is that they are the only ones that honestly call me by my pronouns and actual name. It doesn\u2019t matter to my stepdad or extended family on his side. Everyone misgenders me and deadnames me constantly even though I\u2019ve been out for 6 years. They are very conservative and are trump supporters, so I\u2019m terrified to defend myself any time they start talking about anything trans related. I\u2019m honestly tired of being expected to hide how I\u2019m feeling by allowing people to treat me poorly just to make them more comfortable. Hell, my uncle even told my little sister (she\u2019s 7) right in front of me that gender and sex are the same thing and that people who think differently are wrong as if he was trying to teach her to hate me. It\u2019s not like I barely see these people: we are constantly around them. Even being home for a week for holidays just makes me feel like absolute garbage.\n\nBefore I\u2019d just ignore it and try not to let it get to me personally. I\u2019m tired of it though. It just makes me feel awful and sad and hurt because these people obviously don\u2019t love or care about me enough to even call me the right name. I used to struggle with depression and anxiety and I have finally gotten to a good place about six months ago. I don\u2019t want to start feeling that way again just because I\u2019d be forced to be around people like that. I haven\u2019t even told them I\u2019m nonbinary. I only discovered that less than a year ago, since I used to think I was trans. I\u2019m never going to tell them I\u2019m nonbinary because getting the binary trans thing is already this difficult. I don\u2019t want to make things worse. \n\nSo I guess, what would you decide? Would you stay in New York City to keep yourself happy, or would you go stay with family upstate to avoid a potential lockdown and to make your mom happy?"

    "body":"I came out as a trans man at 13. I always knew I was nonbinary, but I tried to come at as bigender early in my social transition, and everyone rejected me. I was androgynous before T because of untreated PCOS, so I never had a huge issue passing as male if I put a little effort in. I've been harassed and abused by partners and people who know I'm trans, but I didn't get much flak from random cis men because they used to think I'm one of them, unless they think I'm gay. Even then, it's never been this bad.\n\nEvery time I've presented as anything but a typical cis guy, I get relentlessly baraged with harassment. I don't know why. Most of them seem to want to have sex with me. I presented more femininely from 16-17 and got hit on by my dad's male friends, as well as by totally random older men. I have now officially come out as nonbinary and am dressing how I want. I already have a very distinctive appearance that I cannot change, and I have added hair dye and new clothes with different cuts and accessories to my look. I don't look or sound like a cis woman. I love my appearance now, and I'm having so much fun, but people look at me more than I want. I'm not sure if they think I'm a butch woman, a feminine man, a trans woman, or a trans man, but they know I'm queer. I've thought about making myself look masculine again, or at least dress casual, but I don't want to! I would be so sad.\n\nI had a date with a woman scheduled today. I was taking the bus, and a big guy sat beside me even though there were lots of seats. He reeked. Not of B.O., but of the same smell (?) as other people who have harassed me. He said a lot of homophobic, sexual things and pushed me. He shoved his hands in my face, and I grabbed his phone (he was trying to write slurs on his Notes app and show me) and threw it across the bus. The driver made him stand, but didn't kick him off. He kept talking about me and calling me Satanic (already got Calvinist Guilt, so thanks?), and the other people told him to shut up. He still kept going. \n\nI'm safe. I went to a caf\u00e9 I'm familiar with, and they let me hide. There were these two very muscular people who stayed until I got into my Uber. My friends have all rallied around me.But I'm shaken and sad. I feel like giving up. I want to look how I want, but I feel like all the horrible people see me as a target. I live in a very progressive area, but I'm scared now, just as I was when I've been followed or threatened years before. I feel like I can never escape. If I don't dress in jeans and a T-shirt or something like that, I get followed and harassed and assaulted. It feels like I can't even go to my favorite fried chicken place without being stalked by scary people, or walk down the street without men calling out to me.\n\nIs there any light at the end of the tunnel? I feel awful. I feel like I'll never be safe from sexual harassment and assault as long as I live. Can I never be androgynous and happy?"

I had a gyno appointment today and luckily the doctor I saw was super trans friendly and let me know I could take half the gel or take it every other day or work out something else with my doc. It was super helpful to learn that this process is gonna look different for everyone and I can work with my doc to sort this out. I\u2019m gonna reach out to my doc about that and lowering things a bit and I\u2019m starting therapy next week so hopefully all that\u2019ll help. Gonna leave this post up in case it helps anyone."

It is about 50% the causes of my daily depression episodes and s word thoughts (I\u2019m not gonna do it so please don\u2019t send me the s word hotline number) and anxiety but I told my family member I wanted to shave my head because I didn\u2019t feel like doing it, which should be a valid enough reason you shouldn\u2019t have to do something you don\u2019t want to that\u2019ll not effect your life in anyway your hair doesn\u2019t pay your bills, get you to work everyday or feed your family so why is it so important to some people to force this on them? I know they only does this to me because I\u2019m AFAB and if I was AMAB they\u2019d probably buy me a razor and do it for me. I was thinking of doing it as an impulse one day but I still get anxiety thinking about it doing it and the only razor I have is a shick intuition women\u2019s razor. What should I do? I need this so much."

    "body":"I've been seeing a friend of mine for a few months. It's been going alright, but there is something that keeps irritating me:\n\nOn several occasions my partner has by default adressed me in ways you would adress a person who is the binary gender that is not my AGAB. When my partner makes me compliments, the compliments are gendered, again stereotypical compliments for the gender that is not my AGAB. \n\nEven sex has changed. While we were trying many different things in the beginning and spent a lot of time cuddling, my partner now asks specific acts from me. Those acts require me to take on a rather clear-cut role. I emulate body parts that I currently do not have. That in itself would be fine, but it kind of breaks my heart to see my partner get more pleasure out of that, than out of everything else we did before.\n\nIt feels like my partner is imagining me as a gender I am not. I am non-binary. I feel like I have a bit of all genders in me, and none at the same time. To me, non-binary does **not** mean \"the mind has binary transitioned, but the body hasn't\" or something in that order. Right now it feels like my partner treats me as \\[opposite of my AGAB\\] in the body of an \\[AGAB\\].\n\nLast week we had a small disagreement. My partner wanted to cut my hair sometime soon. But I changed my mind about it. Hairdressing is kind of a big deal for me (I'm autistic and have sensory issues with my hair). I've only had another person cut my hair once in the last 11 years. And when my partner said that I needed a more \"non-binary\" haircut, I didn't feel like it anymore. To me \"non-binary\" is not a specific look and I don't like the idea that I have to look a certain way to be seen as my gender.\n\nAnother potential problem is that my partner's friend group doesn't accept my identity. My partner is binary trans and so is most of the friendgroup. My partner told me that the friends misgender me when I'm out of earshot. And that one of the friends disliked me at first, because I \"looked too basic\" and they assumed I must be binary trans based on that. Some of them use non-binary as a label for \"non-passing\" binary trans people.\n\nI like my partner and there are many good things happening between us. But all of this is ringing my alarm bells and starting to stress me out. I tried talking about it, but it was kind of brushed off with a general \"But you know I accept you the way you are, right?\". I do have a hard time articulating what I need. But it becomes even harder to do that, when there is already an assumption in place that I need to counter.\n\nCan someone here understand this? Am I being too much in my own head? I'd really appreciate any outside perspective, but it already helped writing all of this down."

    "body":"Honest preface: my gender and sexual identities are things that I try not to think about or recognize because I really don't want to be \"different\" and I wonder if I'm just trying to stick extra labels on myself since I already have a number of mental illnesses. I'm also afraid my MIs (CPTSD and BPD) are making me think I relate to identities that I'm actually not.\n\nI wrote a long post somewhere else but got insecure and took it down so here's kind of a brief summary... I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.\n\nI also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend. Whenever I'm around other women\/female friends I feel uncomfortable and like I'm missing something and don't work properly as a \"woman\". Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words \"woman\" or \"girl\" to myself. I hate having \"good girl\" said to me but I like \"good boy\". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.\n\nBut I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man. I'm afraid of men. But my closest friends in life (ie the people I've felt most comfortable around) have been androgynous or feminine leaning men.  \n\nI used to say I wouldn't mind being reborn as a boy but now I don't really feel much of either. It would be really nice if the world suddenly became genderless and everyone were somewhere in between, because those are the people I'm most comfortable around. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns but I think it'd be nice if they were just implemented for everyone. \n\nI definitely feel like I'm in my own awkward not-real-woman corner, just a person. I definitely don't want to identify as \"both man and woman\", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming \"prettier\". \n\nWhat am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently. I'm also a victim of intense lifelong child abuse which may be giving me the confusion but that means I have trouble handling the idea of people being angry at me. Thanks for your patience. "

    "body":"Warning: Gender dysphoria, CSA\n\nI'm really confused lately and I need advice from other people who have been in a similar situation or have chest dysphoria. For context, I've only come to realize that I'm non-binary for about 4-5 months but I've always known that I don't feel aligned at all with binary gender since I was a child. Coming to terms with my gender identity is one of the happiest moments in my life and helps me grow as an individual. But as I become more and more acquainted with myself, I figure out that I may have chest dysphoria. \n\nI've recently only come to my senses of body image and body sensation because due to my past trauma of being sexual abused as a child, I dissociated with my body all the time, like it is not even there. My mental health has improved significantly from last year, giving me the chance to finally look into who I am and who I want to become. Physically presented, I lean toward the masculine side (I love having a buff and masculine body, my shoulders are wide compared to my body frame as well) and dressing androgynously but my chests always destroy that image, it stands out like a sore thumb and looking at myself in the mirror makes me feel dysphoric. I've always fancied a more man-like body to myself with a muscular chest and not the female breast and sometimes I feel so hard to breathe knowing my actual body doesn't match up to it.\n\nI've talked with my mom about this problem, she told me that whatever decision I make regarding the removal of my breasts, she will support me. But now I know I have the choice to go through surgery, I become horrified of the possibility. What if I regret it? We are talking about cutting off a part of the body. What if afterward I suffer the dysphoria in a different way and I can never take back the decision I make? These thoughts keep me up at night and I feel so suffocated. \n\nThere are moments I just know I will be better off without these breasts, when I put on my T-shirt looking at my broad shoulders when I want to be shirtless at the beach. I've already ordered a binder to see how things will go from then but I'm still really confused and scared. Can anyone give me any advice or willing to talk more about this? Should I inform my GP about this (I'm an international student studying in the UK)? \n\nThanks in advance"

    "body":"For me, puberty was the beginning of a pretty severe existential crisis, and said puberty started really early. I already had hair and breasts at 7 or 8 and I got my period at 8 or 9. But that alone is probably a good reason to feel strange and uncomfortable with your own physique at that age. What is certain is that I tried as hard as I could for as long as I could to ignore all physical developments and hide them later. My mum always described it that way, it's in my doctor's letter from my first hospitalisation (I think I was 12 \/ 13 then) and I'm regularly asked about my pronouns very unexpectedly and randomly (which doesn't necessarily mean anything at first). But I have the feeling that I only have a partnership of convenience with my body and am only forced to accept it. But I don't think I'm \"suffering\" either.\n\nAt this point, however, I always remind myself that I have a very negative relationship with my \"visible femininity\" due to repeated rapes of varying degrees and too many sexual assaults and that I am not really able to differentiate thoughts and feelings appropriately in this context.\n\nIn any case, I have had very pronounced and detailed violent fantasies about my breasts for years, which occasionally manifest themselves in dreams. I feel wrong, disgusting and I don't know what to do.\n\nWhat can I do apart from talking to my therapist? I need help. Is there a way to get rid of my titties without paying thousands of euros?"

And it fucking sucks.\n\nNothing except casual everyday clothes make me feel good or completely like myself. I never know what the hell to wear to a fancier event, because both a full dress and a full suit make me feel extremely dysphoric. Anything remotely feminine or masculine makes me feel like shit, but there's really no in-between that I've found.\n\nI'm afab and have pretty big boobs that also make me super dysphoric, and I'm looking to get top surgery. However, recently I got another fear \u2014 what if a permanent flat chest also makes me dysphoric because its too masculine? I bind pretty much every day, but this fear has definitely risen to the top of my mind lately.\n\nWhat am I supposed to do? Am I supposed to just live my life forever never feeling completely like myself? Honestly I wish I was just either transmasc or transfem so I'd have at least some sort of direction and goals I'd want with my transition (Not trying to dismiss their struggles of course, I know it's hard for you too). I honestly can't really see much of a happy, fully transitioned future for myself like this.\n\nDoes anyone have similar experiences? What am I supposed to do about this?\n\n"
