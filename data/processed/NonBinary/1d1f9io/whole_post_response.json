      "content": "I was assaulted today and I'm scared for the future (TW: sexual harassment)\n\nI came out as a trans man at 13. I always knew I was nonbinary, but I tried to come at as bigender early in my social transition, and everyone rejected me. I was androgynous before T because of untreated PCOS, so I never had a huge issue passing as male if I put a little effort in. I've been harassed and abused by partners and people who know I'm trans, but I didn't get much flak from random cis men because they used to think I'm one of them, unless they think I'm gay. Even then, it's never been this bad.\n\nEvery time I've presented as anything but a typical cis guy, I get relentlessly baraged with harassment. I don't know why. Most of them seem to want to have sex with me. I presented more femininely from 16-17 and got hit on by my dad's male friends, as well as by totally random older men. I have now officially come out as nonbinary and am dressing how I want. I already have a very distinctive appearance that I cannot change, and I have added hair dye and new clothes with different cuts and accessories to my look. I don't look or sound like a cis woman. I love my appearance now, and I'm having so much fun, but people look at me more than I want. I'm not sure if they think I'm a butch woman, a feminine man, a trans woman, or a trans man, but they know I'm queer. I've thought about making myself look masculine again, or at least dress casual, but I don't want to! I would be so sad.\n\nI had a date with a woman scheduled today. I was taking the bus, and a big guy sat beside me even though there were lots of seats. He reeked. Not of B.O., but of the same smell (?) as other people who have harassed me. He said a lot of homophobic, sexual things and pushed me. He shoved his hands in my face, and I grabbed his phone (he was trying to write slurs on his Notes app and show me) and threw it across the bus. The driver made him stand, but didn't kick him off. He kept talking about me and calling me Satanic (already got Calvinist Guilt, so thanks?), and the other people told him to shut up. He still kept going. \n\nI'm safe. I went to a caf\u00e9 I'm familiar with, and they let me hide. There were these two very muscular people who stayed until I got into my Uber. My friends have all rallied around me.But I'm shaken and sad. I feel like giving up. I want to look how I want, but I feel like all the horrible people see me as a target. I live in a very progressive area, but I'm scared now, just as I was when I've been followed or threatened years before. I feel like I can never escape. If I don't dress in jeans and a T-shirt or something like that, I get followed and harassed and assaulted. It feels like I can't even go to my favorite fried chicken place without being stalked by scary people, or walk down the street without men calling out to me.\n\nIs there any light at the end of the tunnel? I feel awful. I feel like I'll never be safe from sexual harassment and assault as long as I live. Can I never be androgynous and happy?"

      "content": "I am so incredibly sorry that you experienced this assault and harassment today. That sounds absolutely terrifying, and the fact that you had to physically defend yourself and then seek refuge is a testament to your strength, but it is a horrific burden to bear.\n\nPlease know that **your feelings are completely valid.** It is natural to be shaken, sad, and to feel like giving up after such a violation. You did the right thing by getting to a safe place, utilizing the kindness of the people at the caf\u00e9, and reaching out to your friends.\n\n---\n\n### Immediate Safety Check and Resources\n\nBefore we talk about the future, I want to make sure you have access to immediate, professional support if you need it right now.\n\n**If you are in the US or Canada:**\n\n*   **RAINN (Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network):** 1-800-656-HOPE (24/7 confidential support for sexual violence survivors).\n*   **The Trevor Project:** 1-866-488-7386 (Crisis intervention and suicide prevention for LGBTQ youth, available 24/7).\n*   **Crisis Text Line:** Text HOME to 741741.\n\nIt is completely up to you whether you choose to report this incident to the police or seek medical care, but if you feel you need to talk to a professional advocate about your options, RAINN is an excellent, confidential resource.\n\n---\n\n### Addressing the Core Struggle: Safety vs. Self-Expression\n\nWhat you are describing\u2014the cruel dilemma between being safe and being yourself\u2014is a profound and devastating reality for many queer, gender-nonconforming, and trans people.\n\n**Let me be absolutely clear: The problem is not your appearance. The problem is the people who choose to target you.**\n\nYou are allowed to be happy. You are allowed to be androgynous. You are allowed to wear the clothes and accessories that bring you joy. The fact that expressing your authentic self makes you a target is a reflection of the bigotry and violence that exists in the world, not a failure or mistake on your part.\n\nYou feel this pressure to retreat back into a masculine presentation that you don't want, and it is heartbreaking that you even have to consider sacrificing your joy for basic safety.\n\n> Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?\n\nYes, there is light. The light isn't a world where these people instantly disappear, but a world where you learn to navigate the risks while maximizing your joy and minimizing your vulnerability, supported by a strong community.\n\n### Finding the Light: Strategies for Moving Forward\n\nThe feeling that you\u2019ll never be safe is overwhelming right now because your trauma is so fresh. We can\u2019t guarantee perfect safety, but we can focus on building resilience, community, and specific strategies.\n\n#### 1. Lean on Your Community (The Proof You Aren't Alone)\n\nYou mentioned that your friends rallied around you, the people on the bus intervened, and the caf\u00e9 staff protected you. This is the light. You are surrounded by people who see you, love you, and value your safety and expression.\n\n*   **Buddy System:** When you are going to highly visible places (like your favorite fried chicken spot) or using public transit, try to coordinate with a friend. Having another person present often acts as a significant deterrent.\n*   **Share Your Location:** Use apps to share your location with close friends or partners whenever you are traveling alone, especially at night or on public transit.\n\n#### 2. Reclaiming Your Space and Appearance\n\nThe idea of making yourself look masculine again is a trauma response\u2014a desperate attempt to control an uncontrollable situation by masking. While safety must be prioritized, giving up your identity entirely gives the aggressors exactly what they want: silencing you.\n\nInstead of changing *who you are*, focus on **where you go and how you move.**\n\n*   **Establish Safe Zones:** Continue using places like that caf\u00e9 where you are known and welcomed. Seek out businesses that are explicitly LGBTQ+ friendly.\n*   **Strategic Visibility:** While you love your look, if there are certain accessories or colors that make you feel *particularly* vulnerable in certain environments, maybe save them for times when you are with friends or in proven safe spaces. This is a compromise, not a surrender.\n*   **Self-Defense Awareness:** Knowing how to quickly assess and extract yourself from a dangerous situation can be empowering. If available, consider taking a self-defense class focused on boundary setting and situational awareness.\n\n#### 3. Processing the Trauma\n\nThe trauma you experienced on the bus is compounded by years of prior harassment. This is heavy, and you shouldn't carry it alone.\n\n*   **Seek Out a Queer-Affirming Therapist:** A therapist (specifically one knowledgeable about gender identity and trauma) can help you process the fear, the Calvinist Guilt you mentioned, and the feeling of being a target. They can help you develop coping mechanisms that don't involve sacrificing your identity.\n*   **Journaling/Art:** Sometimes just getting the fear out onto paper can help lessen its hold on you.\n\nYou are not wrong for wanting to be yourself. You are not wrong for being visible. The fact that you are so determined to live authentically, despite the very real dangers you face, is incredible. We can work together to help you find ways to live happily and safely in your androgynous presentation without feeling like you have to disappear.\n\nWhat kind of support feels most helpful to you right now? Are you looking for more practical strategies, or do you just need a space to continue processing the unfairness of it all?"
