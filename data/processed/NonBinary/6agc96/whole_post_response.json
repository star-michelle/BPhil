      "content": "Am I nonbinary if I want to be conventionally attractive by feminine standards?\n\nHonest preface: my gender and sexual identities are things that I try not to think about or recognize because I really don't want to be \"different\" and I wonder if I'm just trying to stick extra labels on myself since I already have a number of mental illnesses. I'm also afraid my MIs (CPTSD and BPD) are making me think I relate to identities that I'm actually not.\n\nI wrote a long post somewhere else but got insecure and took it down so here's kind of a brief summary... I'm afab and like (androgynous leaning) female fashion, makeup, etc. I desperately want to be considered conventionally attractive.\n\nI also (maybe because of my lifelong abuse and trauma) never felt like I fit in with other girls or women. Sometimes I feel like cis women are living a totally different life than I am (except maybe rn I'm just being a whiny cis woman lol if so I apologize.) I've never really had a close female friend. Whenever I'm around other women/female friends I feel uncomfortable and like I'm missing something and don't work properly as a \"woman\". Oh, and I don't really feel comfortable applying the words \"woman\" or \"girl\" to myself. I hate having \"good girl\" said to me but I like \"good boy\". When I have stuffed animals I always call them by male pronouns.\n\nBut I don't really feel like a guy either. I was neglected by my father, bullied by my brother and abused by an older man. I'm afraid of men. But my closest friends in life (ie the people I've felt most comfortable around) have been androgynous or feminine leaning men.  \n\nI used to say I wouldn't mind being reborn as a boy but now I don't really feel much of either. It would be really nice if the world suddenly became genderless and everyone were somewhere in between, because those are the people I'm most comfortable around. I wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns but I think it'd be nice if they were just implemented for everyone. \n\nI definitely feel like I'm in my own awkward not-real-woman corner, just a person. I definitely don't want to identify as \"both man and woman\", more like neither. Except I still like feminine (somewhat, more androgynous is better) fashion, makeup, and care a lot about becoming \"prettier\". \n\nWhat am I? If the answer is just a cis woman who needs to stfu, please let me know gently. I'm also a victim of intense lifelong child abuse which may be giving me the confusion but that means I have trouble handling the idea of people being angry at me. Thanks for your patience. "

      "content": "This is a really thoughtful and honest post, and I appreciate you sharing such vulnerable feelings and experiences with me. Please know that you are in a safe space here, and there is absolutely nothing you need to apologize for. You are not \"whiny,\" and your feelings\u2014including your confusion and desire for clarity\u2014are completely valid and deserve to be explored gently.\n\nThe honest preface you shared about being afraid of being \"different\" and worrying about the influence of mental health conditions is a very common concern when people start exploring their identity. It\u2019s important to remember that **mental illnesses do not define or invalidate your core identity.** Many people, whether they have mental health diagnoses or not, go through periods of intense self-questioning. Your trauma and experiences shape your life, but they don't necessarily invent your gender identity\u2014they might just make the process of figuring it out more complicated or scary.\n\nLet's address your main question and the various points you brought up:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Am I nonbinary if I want to be conventionally attractive by feminine standards?\n\n**The short answer is: Yes, absolutely.**\n\nGender identity (who you are internally) and gender expression (how you present yourself externally, through clothes, makeup, hair, etc.) are two different things.\n\n*   **Gender Identity** is about your internal sense of self (Do you feel like a woman, a man, both, neither, or something else?).\n*   **Gender Expression** is about how you choose to look.\n\nMany nonbinary people\u2014and people of all genders\u2014love and use makeup, wear dresses, or present in ways that are conventionally seen as \"feminine.\"\n\n*   A nonbinary person who was assigned female at birth (AFAB) can still wear a full face of makeup and a dress.\n*   A nonbinary person who was assigned male at birth (AMAB) can still have a beard and wear suits.\n\n**Your desire to be conventionally attractive by feminine standards relates to your expression and aesthetic preferences, not your core gender identity.** It doesn't cancel out the possibility of being nonbinary.\n\n## 2. Analyzing Your Feelings\n\nLet's look at the specific points you shared that suggest you might be exploring a gender identity outside of being a cis woman:\n\n*   **Discomfort with \"Woman\" or \"Girl\" Labels:** You explicitly state you don't feel comfortable applying these words to yourself.\n*   **The \"Good Boy\" vs. \"Good Girl\" Preference:** This is a very telling detail. Preferring a traditionally masculine affirmation (\"good boy\") over a traditionally feminine one (\"good girl\") suggests a detachment from the female identity.\n*   **Feeling Separate from Cis Women:** You mention feeling like you don't fit in, are \"missing something,\" and don't \"work properly as a 'woman'.\" This feeling of being fundamentally different from your assigned gender group is a common experience for many nonbinary people.\n*   **The Desire for Genderlessness:** Your statement that it would be nice if the world became genderless and everyone were \"somewhere in between\" aligns very closely with nonbinary identity, particularly identities like **agender** (lacking gender) or **neutrois** (neutral gender).\n*   **Identifying as \"Neither\":** You explicitly say you don't want to identify as \"both man and woman,\" but more like **\"neither,\"** and that you feel like **\"just a person.\"** This is a classic description of nonbinary identity, which exists outside the man/woman binary.\n\n## 3. What Does This Mean for You?\n\nBased on everything you have shared\u2014especially the strong feeling of being \"neither,\" the discomfort with being called a woman, and the preference for a genderless existence\u2014it sounds like you are describing an experience that fits within the **nonbinary** umbrella.\n\n**Nonbinary** simply means any gender identity that is not exclusively man or exclusively woman.\n\nIf you don't feel like a woman, and you don't feel like a man, you are likely nonbinary.\n\n### A Gentle Suggestion for Labels:\n\nIf the word \"nonbinary\" feels too big or scary right now, you might try seeing how these more specific terms feel:\n\n*   **Agender:** A person who identifies as having no gender. This aligns well with your feeling of being \"just a person.\"\n*   **Genderqueer:** A broader term that often means someone whose gender identity is outside the binary.\n*   **Nonbinary Woman/Girl:** Some people who are nonbinary still feel some connection to their AFAB identity but not fully. However, based on your discomfort with \"woman\" and \"girl,\" this might not fit you.\n\nYou are describing a very real, nonbinary experience. You are not a \"whiny cis woman who needs to stfu.\" You are a person who has spent a lifetime navigating complex feelings and trauma, and you are finally giving yourself permission to ask who you truly are.\n\n## Next Steps for Exploration\n\nYou don't have to announce anything to the world right now, but you can explore this privately to see what feels authentic:\n\n1.  **Test the Pronouns (Privately):** You mentioned you wouldn't feel comfortable asking for non-gendered pronouns, but you can try them out in your own head. When you look in the mirror, try thinking: \"They are wearing a nice shirt\" or \"He is a good person\" (if you want to try masculine pronouns, given your comfort with \"good boy\"). See how those feel compared to \"She is...\"\n2.  **Try the Labels (Internally):** Try thinking of yourself as \"nonbinary\" or \"agender\" for a few days. Does it feel like a relief? Does it feel right? If it makes you feel more seen and understood, that's a good sign.\n3.  **Acknowledge the Trauma and the Fear:** It is completely understandable that your history of abuse and trauma, particularly involving men, makes your relationship with gender complicated. You are afraid of men, but your most comfortable friends are feminine men. This is complex! Your identity is likely separate from your trauma, but the trauma affects how you interact with gendered roles and expectations. Be patient with yourself as you untangle these threads.\n\nYour identity is valid, regardless of your history or your current mental health. You are allowed to be nonbinary and still enjoy feminine aesthetics. **Your attraction to prettiness is a style choice; your feeling of being \"neither\" is your gender identity.**\n\nTake a deep breath. You are doing great work in trying to figure this out. How does reading this make you feel?"
