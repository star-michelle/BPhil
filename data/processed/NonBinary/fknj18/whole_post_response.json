      "content": "What would you choose?\n\nI live in New York City and my family lives upstate. I\u2019m currently having a hard time deciding whether to stay here or go, since we might be enacting essentially a lockdown of the city. Our state governor is currently against that idea, but that also might change at any time.\n\nI live independently in my own apartment as a grad student. I don\u2019t mind being here by myself. I\u2019m actually enjoying it, really. I\u2019m allowed to work from home and have been doing so, so I have a steady income so far.\n\nI\u2019d feel horrible if I decide to stay here and not go though. My mom worries a lot, and I know she\u2019d want me to go stay with her and my family.  I love my mom and my sisters and I do miss them and I know they miss me too. Problem is that they are the only ones that honestly call me by my pronouns and actual name. It doesn\u2019t matter to my stepdad or extended family on his side. Everyone misgenders me and deadnames me constantly even though I\u2019ve been out for 6 years. They are very conservative and are trump supporters, so I\u2019m terrified to defend myself any time they start talking about anything trans related. I\u2019m honestly tired of being expected to hide how I\u2019m feeling by allowing people to treat me poorly just to make them more comfortable. Hell, my uncle even told my little sister (she\u2019s 7) right in front of me that gender and sex are the same thing and that people who think differently are wrong as if he was trying to teach her to hate me. It\u2019s not like I barely see these people: we are constantly around them. Even being home for a week for holidays just makes me feel like absolute garbage.\n\nBefore I\u2019d just ignore it and try not to let it get to me personally. I\u2019m tired of it though. It just makes me feel awful and sad and hurt because these people obviously don\u2019t love or care about me enough to even call me the right name. I used to struggle with depression and anxiety and I have finally gotten to a good place about six months ago. I don\u2019t want to start feeling that way again just because I\u2019d be forced to be around people like that. I haven\u2019t even told them I\u2019m nonbinary. I only discovered that less than a year ago, since I used to think I was trans. I\u2019m never going to tell them I\u2019m nonbinary because getting the binary trans thing is already this difficult. I don\u2019t want to make things worse. \n\nSo I guess, what would you decide? Would you stay in New York City to keep yourself happy, or would you go stay with family upstate to avoid a potential lockdown and to make your mom happy?"

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult situation, and I appreciate you sharing all the details and context. It takes courage to lay out all these conflicting factors, especially when you are navigating a stressful global situation on top of complex family dynamics.\n\nI can't tell you what you *should* decide, because this is your life and your choice, and ultimately, you are the expert on what is best for your well-being.\n\nHowever, I can help you break down the factors you've presented and weigh the potential outcomes of each choice, focusing on your priorities and needs.\n\nLet's look at the two options through the lenses of **Safety/Logistics** and **Emotional/Mental Health**.\n\n---\n\n## Option 1: Stay in New York City\n\n### The Pros (Focusing on You)\n\n*   **Mental Health Protection:** You are currently in a good place mentally, and staying in your own apartment protects that stability. You are enjoying your independence, working well from home, and avoiding the major stressors of misgendering, deadnaming, and transphobic rhetoric.\n*   **Comfort and Independence:** You enjoy being by yourself and have a steady income. You are in control of your environment.\n*   **Logistical Clarity (Currently):** Your work situation is stable and you don't mind the current restrictions.\n\n### The Cons (Focusing on External Factors)\n\n*   **The Lockdown Risk:** This is the major unknown. While the governor is currently against it, the situation could change, potentially leading to more severe restrictions, limited access to resources (though NYC is well-stocked), and a feeling of being \"trapped\" if you later decide you want to leave.\n*   **Mom's Worry:** Your mother will be worried, and you will feel \"horrible\" about causing her stress. This is a significant emotional weight.\n*   **Distance from Support:** If you were to get sick or need physical help, you would be navigating that alone.\n\n---\n\n## Option 2: Go Stay Upstate with Family\n\n### The Pros (Focusing on Others/Logistics)\n\n*   **Avoids Lockdown Risk:** You eliminate the risk of being confined in the city if severe measures are enacted.\n*   **Mom's Happiness/Worry Relief:** You would fulfill your mother's desire for you to be safe and close, alleviating her anxiety and your guilt about causing it.\n*   **Supportive Core Family:** You would be with your mom and sisters, who are the only ones who respect your name and pronouns. You miss them, and they miss you.\n\n### The Cons (Focusing on You)\n\n*   **Severe Mental Health Risk:** This is the most critical drawback. You would be constantly exposed to misgendering, deadnaming, and transphobic conversations from your stepdad and extended family. You know from experience (holidays) that this makes you feel \"absolute garbage\" and has the potential to trigger a return to depression and anxiety, which you have just successfully managed to overcome.\n*   **Forced Hiding and Exhaustion:** You would be forced to hide a significant part of yourself (your nonbinary identity) and constantly monitor your reactions to avoid conflict, leading to emotional exhaustion and resentment.\n*   **Lack of Control:** You lose the control and independence you currently have in your own apartment.\n\n---\n\n## Reframing the Decision\n\nRight now, you are balancing **Logistical Safety** (avoiding a potential lockdown) against **Emotional/Mental Safety** (protecting your well-being).\n\n### A Crucial Question to Consider:\n\n**What is the greater danger to your life and stability right now?**\n\n1.  The potential inconvenience and isolation of a future, uncertain lockdown in NYC, where you are mentally stable?\n2.  The near-certainty of mental anguish, emotional harm, and potential relapse into depression/anxiety caused by daily exposure to a hostile environment upstate?\n\nYou have worked incredibly hard over the last six months to get to a good mental place. That stability is a vital resource, especially during a crisis.\n\n### Finding a Middle Ground or Mitigation Strategies\n\nIf you decide to **stay in NYC**, how can you mitigate your mom's worry?\n\n*   **Communicate Constantly:** Call or video chat with your mom and sisters daily. Reassure your mom of your safety, your resources, and your plan. You can be honest that you need your independent space to manage the stress of the pandemic, without having to detail the full family dynamic.\n*   **Acknowledge Her Feelings:** Validate her worry (\"I know you're worried, and I love that you care so much about me\"), but firmly state your choice (\"I have decided that for my mental health, I need to stay in my apartment where I can focus on my work and stability right now\").\n*   **Set a Check-in Date:** \"I am going to stay here for the next two weeks, and we can check in then to see if the situation has changed.\"\n\nIf you decide to **go upstate**, how can you mitigate the harm?\n\n*   **Set Boundaries Immediately:** This is extremely difficult, but necessary. Can you limit interaction with the extended family? Can you stay mostly sequestered in your mother's direct living area?\n*   **Establish an Exit Plan:** Decide ahead of time how long you will stay (e.g., two weeks) and what the absolute boundary violation is (e.g., if Uncle X says Y, I leave immediately). Have money and a transport plan ready to return to NYC if your mental health begins to deteriorate.\n*   **Communicate with Your Mom:** Can you confide in your mom about how much the misgendering hurts you, and ask her to run interference or shield you from the worst offenders?\n\n---\n\n## My Input on Your Priorities\n\nBased on what you have shared, it sounds like **your mental health and stability are the most precious and fragile resources you have right now.**\n\nThe logistical risks of staying in NYC are currently speculative. The emotional risks of going upstate are **certain and severe**, and you have detailed historical evidence of the damage they cause.\n\n**It is not selfish to prioritize your long-term health and stability.** You cannot pour from an empty or damaged cup. Making your mom happy at the expense of relapsing into depression is a trade-off that is likely too costly for you.\n\n**If I were forced to choose based on the goal of maintaining your hard-won mental stability, I would choose to stay in New York City.**\n\nYou are safe, independent, employed, and, most importantly, happy and stable there. You can manage the fear of a lockdown and your mom's worry through communication, but you cannot easily manage the guaranteed emotional abuse of daily deadnaming and misgendering without seriously jeopardizing your mental health."
