I feel more grounded(?) in my body and really am looking forward to some physical changes and mild voice deepening. Today is my 6th day and the first day I felt calm, but after that I\u2019ve been depressed. Not like I wanna not be alive depressed but like unmotivated, crying spells, etc. Depression isn\u2019t new to me but I don\u2019t like feeling like this.  I\u2019m wondering if maybe my dose is too high? Or I just need to wait it out and let my levels settle? I told my doctor I wanted to go slow and wanted a more androgynous/non-binary transition instead of ftm and this is the dose he prescribed. I\u2019m trying to wait things out because it hasn\u2019t even been a week but ugh, it\u2019s difficult because I don\u2019t have any people in my life to support me through this. Anyone relate or have any helpful information?\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the advice/support. I had a gyno appointment today and luckily the doctor I saw was super trans friendly and let me know I could take half the gel or take it every other day or work out something else with my doc. It was super helpful to learn that this process is gonna look different for everyone and I can work with my doc to sort this out. I\u2019m gonna reach out to my doc about that and lowering things a bit and I\u2019m starting therapy next week so hopefully all that\u2019ll help. Gonna leave this post up in case it helps anyone."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to start by saying I hear you. It takes a huge amount of courage to start T, and it is absolutely crushing when that excitement is immediately met with intense emotional difficulty, especially when you don't have a strong support system around you.\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you\u2019re struggling with this, and please know that you are not alone in experiencing mood turbulence during the initial phase of HRT.\n\nHere is some information and validation regarding what you\u2019ve experienced:\n\n---\n\n### 1. Hormonal Fluctuation and Mood\n\nIt is extremely common for people to experience significant mood swings, crying spells, or increased depression/anxiety in the first few weeks or months of starting HRT.\n\n*   **The \"Hormone Rollercoaster\":** When you introduce exogenous hormones (like the T gel) your body is adjusting its entire endocrine system. Your existing dominant hormone levels (usually estrogen) are being suppressed, and your body is trying to figure out how to process the new testosterone. This period of leveling out can cause emotional volatility\u2014sometimes even mimicking the effects of PMS or intense hormonal shifts.\n*   **Too High or Too Low?** Sometimes, depression or anxiety can be a sign that the dose is slightly too high, causing a rapid shift that the body isn't ready for. Other times, it can be a symptom of the body needing more time to adjust to *any* new level of hormones. Since you are only on day six, your body is still very much in the initial adjustment phase.\n\n### 2. Addressing Your Dose and Goals\n\nYou brought up a very important point regarding your desired transition: slow, androgynous, and non-binary.\n\n*   **Individualized Dosing is Key:** Standard FTM starting doses are often higher than what is appropriate for someone seeking a slower, more androgynous transition. For non-binary people seeking a gentle transition, doctors often start with microdosing (a very low dose) to allow for slow changes and more control.\n*   **Your Dose:** While 2.5g of 1% gel is considered a low-to-moderate starting dose for many, it might be too much for your body, especially given your sensitive reaction and your expressed desire to go slow.\n\n### 3. Excellent Steps You\u2019ve Already Taken\n\nI am so glad to read your edit. You have already done two crucial things that are going to help immensely:\n\n1.  **You got medical advice confirming flexibility.** The gyno was absolutely right: T dosing is highly individualized, and you have the power to work with your doctor to adjust the frequency (e.g., every other day) or the amount (e.g., half the gel packet) to find what feels right for your body and your goals.\n2.  **You are starting therapy.** Having professional support, especially when dealing with pre-existing depression and major life changes (like starting hormones), is vital. This will give you a dedicated, safe space to process these intense feelings.\n\n### What to Do Now\n\nSince you already have a plan to contact your prescribing doctor about lowering the dose, that is the safest and most effective next step.\n\n**While you wait for that appointment or conversation:**\n\n*   **Prioritize Self-Care:** Be extremely gentle with yourself. You are undergoing a significant physiological change. If you are experiencing crying spells or low motivation, allow yourself to rest without guilt.\n*   **Document Your Mood:** Keep a quick journal of when you apply the gel and how your mood is 24 hours later. This data will be incredibly helpful for your doctor when discussing dose adjustments.\n*   **Lean on Resources:** Since you mentioned feeling isolated, remember that online trans and non-binary communities can be a great source of immediate, anonymous support and shared experience. You don't have to go through this alone.\n\nIt is frustrating that the thing you started hoping would bring you more peace is currently causing distress, but please hold onto the fact that **this is temporary.** You are taking proactive steps to manage the dose, and the initial hormonal turbulence will settle down as your body adjusts to the new equilibrium.\n\nYou're doing great by listening to your body and advocating for yourself. Keep following up with your doctors!"
