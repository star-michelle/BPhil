It's been going alright, but there is something that keeps irritating me:\n\nOn several occasions my partner has by default adressed me in ways you would adress a person who is the binary gender that is not my AGAB. When my partner makes me compliments, the compliments are gendered, again stereotypical compliments for the gender that is not my AGAB. \n\nEven sex has changed. While we were trying many different things in the beginning and spent a lot of time cuddling, my partner now asks specific acts from me. Those acts require me to take on a rather clear-cut role. I emulate body parts that I currently do not have. That in itself would be fine, but it kind of breaks my heart to see my partner get more pleasure out of that, than out of everything else we did before.\n\nIt feels like my partner is imagining me as a gender I am not. I am non-binary. I feel like I have a bit of all genders in me, and none at the same time. To me, non-binary does **not** mean \"the mind has binary transitioned, but the body hasn't\" or something in that order. Right now it feels like my partner treats me as \\[opposite of my AGAB\\] in the body of an \\[AGAB\\].\n\nLast week we had a small disagreement. My partner wanted to cut my hair sometime soon. But I changed my mind about it. Hairdressing is kind of a big deal for me (I'm autistic and have sensory issues with my hair). I've only had another person cut my hair once in the last 11 years. And when my partner said that I needed a more \"non-binary\" haircut, I didn't feel like it anymore. To me \"non-binary\" is not a specific look and I don't like the idea that I have to look a certain way to be seen as my gender.\n\nAnother potential problem is that my partner's friend group doesn't accept my identity. My partner is binary trans and so is most of the friendgroup. My partner told me that the friends misgender me when I'm out of earshot. And that one of the friends disliked me at first, because I \"looked too basic\" and they assumed I must be binary trans based on that. Some of them use non-binary as a label for \"non-passing\" binary trans people.\n\nI like my partner and there are many good things happening between us. But all of this is ringing my alarm bells and starting to stress me out. I tried talking about it, but it was kind of brushed off with a general \"But you know I accept you the way you are, right?\". I do have a hard time articulating what I need. But it becomes even harder to do that, when there is already an assumption in place that I need to counter.\n\nCan someone here understand this? Am I being too much in my own head? I'd really appreciate any outside perspective, but it already helped writing all of this down."

      "content": "This is a deeply insightful and difficult situation to be navigating. Thank you for articulating all of this so clearly.\n\nPlease know this right away: **You are absolutely not being too much in your own head.** Every single one of the observations you have made is valid, highly concerning, and points toward a fundamental mismatch in understanding and respect within this relationship.\n\nIt takes immense courage to lay out these complex feelings, especially when a partner has already tried to dismiss them. I want to validate your experience point by point.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validation and Understanding\n\nYour definition of non-binary\u2014that it includes a bit of all genders and none at the same time, and is *not* a placeholder for \"binary trans mind in an AGAB body\"\u2014is widely understood and perfectly valid.\n\nWhat you are describing is the profound pain of feeling like your partner is not in a relationship with *you*, but rather with a **projection**\u2014a predetermined character that fits neatly into their existing binary framework.\n\n### The Pattern of Projection\n\nThe gendered compliments, the default addressing, and the expectation of a specific \"non-binary haircut\" all demonstrate a pattern:\n\n*   **The Partner\u2019s Script:** It sounds like your partner\u2019s internalized definition of non-binary for you is simply \"the opposite of your AGAB.\" This is a common form of binary reductionism, where the non-binary identity is only viewed in relation to the two poles, rather than as a spectrum or an identity unto itself.\n*   **The Haircut Incident:** When your partner demanded you get a \"more non-binary\" haircut, they were attempting to enforce an aesthetic conformity. This completely invalidates the truth that **non-binary is an identity, not a look.** Your identity exists regardless of whether you have long hair, short hair, wear a dress, or wear a suit. Your sensory issues surrounding hair make this demand even more disrespectful of your autonomy.\n\n### The Sexual Dynamic and Heartbreak\n\nThis is perhaps the most painful part of your situation, and your feelings of heartbreak are completely understandable.\n\nWhen a partner derives more pleasure from seeing you perform a specific, clear-cut role (especially one that requires you to emulate body parts you don't have), than from the organic intimacy and variety you shared before, it suggests the pleasure is tied to the **fantasy** and not the **reality** of who you are.\n\nYou are feeling reduced to a sexual object defined by a binary role, rather than being desired as a whole, non-binary person. That is a form of emotional and sexual invalidation.\n\n## 2. The Partner\u2019s Environment: A Major Red Flag\n\nThe issues with your partner\u2019s friend group are not just peripheral; they reflect the environment and potentially the underlying beliefs your partner is immersed in.\n\n*   **Tolerated Misgendering:** Your partner knows their friends misgender you when you are not present, and they have not stopped it. A partner who truly accepts you would actively defend you and educate their friends, or distance themselves from people who harm you. Tolerating this misgendering undermines their claim of \"acceptance.\"\n*   **Gatekeeping and Toxic Definitions:** The friend group\u2019s view of \"non-binary\" as a label for \"non-passing\" trans people is a toxic, exclusionary, and deeply harmful form of gatekeeping within the trans community. The fact that your partner is part of this circle, and seemingly accepts their views on your identity (e.g., assuming you must be binary trans because you \"looked too basic\"), is a massive alarm bell.\n\n## 3. Strategies for Articulating Your Needs\n\nYou mentioned that you have difficulty articulating what you need, and it\u2019s even harder when your partner pre-emptively dismisses you with a general reassurance.\n\nThe key is to shift the conversation from **general acceptance** (which they claim to possess) to **specific actions and impact** (which they are failing at).\n\nHere are suggestions for how to approach the conversation, using \"I\" statements focused on the impact of their actions:\n\n### **Step 1: Frame the Conversation Clearly**\n\nStart by countering the dismissal immediately. You need to explain that intentions and feelings are secondary to impact.\n\n> \"I know you *say* you accept me, and I believe you *want* to. But acceptance isn't just a feeling; it's about action, and right now, your actions and expectations are making me feel unseen and hurt. I need to talk about specific things that are happening, because they are stressing me out.\"\n\n### **Step 2: Use Concrete Examples**\n\nWhen talking about your gender, use the examples you wrote here, as they are very powerful:\n\n| Topic | Focus Statement |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Gender Expectations** | \"When you constantly address me using terms associated with [opposite AGAB], or only compliment me based on stereotypes of that gender, it feels like you are relating to me as [opposite AGAB] in my body, not as the non-binary person I actually am. I need you to address me neutrally and see the full spectrum of my gender.\" |\n| **The Sexual Dynamic** | \"I have felt a profound shift in our sex life. When our intimacy now focuses heavily on me taking on a clear-cut binary role, especially one requiring me to emulate body parts I don't have, I feel reduced to a fantasy. It breaks my heart because it suggests you find pleasure in the performance of a gender I am not, which makes me feel undesirable as myself.\" |\n| **The Haircut/Aesthetics** | \"When you suggested I needed a 'non-binary haircut,' it hurt because it implied my identity is tied to a specific aesthetic look. My gender is internal, and I don't need to conform to a style to be seen. Furthermore, my sensory issues make that a huge boundary for me.\" |\n| **The Friend Group** | \"I cannot feel safe or accepted in this relationship when you allow your friends to misgender me and use my identity label as an insult for 'non-passing' people. Your silence on this makes me feel that you prioritize your comfort with your friends over my basic respect and safety. I need to know that you will actively defend me when I am not there.\" |\n\n## 4. Outside Perspective: What Does This Mean for the Relationship?\n\nYour alarm bells are ringing because the issues you\u2019ve raised are not surface-level disagreements; they are about **respect, identity, and fundamental desire.**\n\nYou need to assess whether your partner is capable of moving past their preconceived notions and truly seeing you.\n\n*   **Genuine Acceptance requires Learning:** If your partner is truly committed to you, they must be willing to dismantle their current framework of what \"non-binary\" means (especially if it's influenced by the toxic views of their friends). This means listening, reading, and changing their behavior, even if it feels uncomfortable for them.\n*   **The Cost of Projection:** If they cannot let go of the specific fantasy/role they have placed you in, particularly in your sexual life, the relationship will continue to be painful and invalidating for you. You deserve a partner who desires *you*, not a character you are forced to play.\n\nYou have done the hard work of identifying the problems. The next step is communicating the consequences. If your partner continues to brush you off after you have clearly articulated the specific harm their actions are causing, you will have the answer about the true depth of their acceptance."
