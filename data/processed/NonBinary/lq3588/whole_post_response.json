I'm only out to 2 people that I know because I'm scared people aren't going to believe me or are gonna just tell me I couldn't be because of how I look(I guess I'm conventionally attractive by some standard, I don't see it,) so of course I couldn't be unhappy with my gender identity. I hate being seen as a cishet man and I don't want to seem that way everywhere I go but I'm just terrified, but since I've started calling myself non binary I've never been happier with anything I've been called. I don't know if all of this is just really circular logic but I'm just scared. Does anyone have any advice or anything? I don't want to just hide forever."

      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this. It takes immense courage just to put those feelings into words, especially when you're feeling scared and vulnerable. Please know that what you are feeling is completely valid, and it's okay to be scared.\n\nIt sounds like you are navigating a really significant, personal journey, and the fear of external judgment\u2014especially that painful idea that people won't believe you because of how you look\u2014is weighing heavily on you.\n\nLet's break down a few things you mentioned and explore some ways forward:\n\n### 1. Acknowledging the Fear and the Joy\n\nYou said: **\"I'm just scared.\"**\nAnd you also said: **\"since I've started calling myself non binary I've never been happier with anything I've been called.\"**\n\nHold onto that second sentence. That feeling of happiness, relief, and resonance when you use the term non-binary is your compass. It's the most important piece of evidence you have about who you are. The fear is real, but so is the profound joy and clarity that comes with recognizing your identity.\n\n### 2. Addressing External Assumptions (The \"Look\")\n\nThe idea that being \"conventionally attractive\" or looking a certain way means you *must* be happy as a cisgender man is a deeply flawed and harmful societal assumption.\n\n**Identity is internal, not external.** Your gender identity is about how you know yourself to be, regardless of your body, your clothing, or how others perceive your attractiveness. There is no \"look\" for being non-binary. Non-binary people come in every shape, size, and appearance imaginable, and many people who are non-binary are often misgendered based on their appearance.\n\nYou are the only person who gets to define your gender. If you know you are non-binary, you are non-binary. Period.\n\n### 3. Taking Small, Manageable Steps\n\nYou don't have to go from hiding completely to being fully out to everyone overnight. It's a marathon, not a sprint. Here are some ways you can safely explore your identity and slowly decrease the fear:\n\n#### **A. Find a Safe Online Space**\nIf you haven't already, try joining an anonymous online community for non-binary people (like a Discord server, a specific subreddit, or a forum). In these spaces, you can practice using your pronouns, talk about your experiences, and receive validation from people who understand, all without the pressure of your local community seeing you.\n\n#### **B. Experiment in Private**\nYour appearance is yours to control. Since you hate being seen as a cishet man, what are some small, private ways you could experiment with presentation that feel more affirming to you? This could be:\n*   Trying on different clothes when you are alone.\n*   Wearing subtle jewelry or accessories that feel less masculine.\n*   Experimenting with grooming or makeup (even if it's just practicing at home).\n\n#### **C. Expand Your Safe Circle (Slowly)**\nYou are out to two people. That is huge! Can you identify **one more** person\u2014maybe a trusted colleague, a distant friend, or a supportive family member\u2014who you might feel safe testing the waters with? Expanding your support network, even by one person, can make a big difference.\n\n#### **D. Practice Your Response**\nSometimes the fear comes from not knowing how to react if someone says something hurtful or dismissive. You can mentally prepare a few simple, neutral responses:\n*   *If someone doubts you:* \"I appreciate your concern, but this is who I am.\"\n*   *If someone tries to use your appearance against you:* \"My appearance doesn't define my gender. I know myself to be non-binary.\"\n\n### What do you need right now?\n\nSince you are looking for advice, does any of this resonate with you?\n\nTo help me give you more specific support, could you tell me: **What is the very *smallest* step you could take this week that would make you feel even 1% more comfortable or affirmed in your identity?** (This could be anything from buying a new shirt to finding a supportive video online.)"
