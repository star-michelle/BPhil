Have you tried reaching out to a pediatrician's after-hours line or an urgent care center to get some guidance? What are you thinking about doing next if you don't hear back from the office?"

As a mom, it's normal to want someone to talk to and get some reassurance about your baby's well-being. Have you tried reaching out to a close friend or family member who might be able to offer some emotional support while you wait for the doctor's office to get back to you?"

It's amazing that your frustration is boiling over because of these silly questions when what you really need is someone to take your concerns seriously.

It felt like they weren't taking my concerns seriously at all, like it was no big deal that my baby could have been seriously injured. And honestly, it made me feel so frustrated and helpless, like I'm just not being heard or understood.\""

I guess one small step I could take today is to research some local pediatric urgent care options that might be a better fit for our situation, rather than rushing to the ER if it's not absolutely necessary."
