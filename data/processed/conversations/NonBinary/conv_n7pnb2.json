I don't know if 'non-binary' is the perfect fit either, because on one hand, it acknowledges that gender isn't binary for me, but on the other hand, it's still tied up in these societal expectations and norms that feel limiting. And then there's this whole thing with pronouns - I'm comfortable being referred to as 'she', but at the same time, it feels like it's reinforcing this idea of womanhood that doesn't entirely resonate with me.\""

I think what's hard for me is that when I tried to explore this feeling of being agender with someone close to me, they basically shut down any possibility of considering it. It felt like they were more concerned with preserving their own understanding of me rather than actually listening to my experience. That made me feel like my feelings and identity weren't valid or worthy of exploration.\""

Like, maybe if I had just been more masculine or feminine, they would have taken me seriously. But hearing you talk about how their behavior was invalidating has helped me see that it wasn't about me at all - it's just that they weren't capable of understanding. And now, when I think about gender labels and expectations, I feel a sense of relief knowing that I don't have to fit into one specific box.\""

It takes a lot of courage to question societal norms and expectations, and it sounds like you're finding freedom in not having to fit into a specific box.

It's like my brain is trying to reconcile these two things - that female pronouns don't make me feel bad, but they also don't quite feel right either.\""
