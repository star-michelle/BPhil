I'd set goals for myself and crush them, feeling like I was making progress and moving forward. But now it feels like no matter how hard I try, nothing seems to get done. It's like I'm stuck in this perpetual state of 'not good enough', where everything I do is just half-hearted and unfulfilling.

When I'm scrolling through Instagram, I find myself getting sucked into these highlight reels of other people's lives, thinking 'oh, they're having more fun than me' or 'I should be doing that too'. It's like, I know it's curated, but still...it feels like there's this constant pressure to keep up. And honestly, it's hard for me to stop when I'm feeling stuck and overwhelmed - it just feels like a way to temporarily numb everything.\""

But whenever I try to get back into it, I feel like I'm just going through the motions, you know? Like I'm doing it out of obligation rather than passion.
