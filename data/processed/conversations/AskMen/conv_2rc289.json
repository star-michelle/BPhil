We were both so hyped before the game, and I was actually more nervous than him, which is weird because he's usually the one who's super competitive. But after they lost, he just shut down on me and won't even look at his phone. It feels like a total overreaction, you know? Like, I get that it sucked to lose, but come on, we've had way worse games in our fantasy league and he never acts like this.\""

I guess what I'm hoping is that if we can have an open conversation, maybe he'll start to realize how his actions are impacting others too.\""
