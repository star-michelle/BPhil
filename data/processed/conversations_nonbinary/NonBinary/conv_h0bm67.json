      "content": "First time posting here but I\u2019ve just been really struggling with this. I\u2019m an AMAB nb, I came out to most of my friends about a year ago. My friend from high school, who has been my best friend for a long time, was posting in defense of JK Rowling and basically mimicking her views on biological sex etc. This isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s expressed this, he knows I\u2019m nb, and basically just won\u2019t accept that it\u2019s transphobic because he \u201chold[s] no hate in his heart for trans people, but think[s] gender identity and physical sex are different.\u201d I told him he was being stubborn and ignorant and he said that he isn\u2019t sure he can be friends with someone who sees him that way. \n\nIt just sucks really bad. He and I play games together constantly and it\u2019s long been my main source of relaxation, and we\u2019ve been friends for 10 years. He made me feel like it\u2019s my fault for being so ideological or rigid, but I\u2019m really hurt by all his bullshit. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m asking for advice or sympathy, but I\u2019m so depressed I just don\u2019t know what to do or how to feel. Sorry for the long post or if I used the wrong tag"

      "content": "Sweetheart, I'm so glad you posted here and shared your feelings with us. It takes a lot of courage to do that.\n\nFirstly, let me acknowledge that it can be really tough when someone close to us expresses views that are harmful or transphobic. It's like, shouldn't they know better? Shouldn't they understand the impact their words have?\n\nI want you to know that your feelings are valid, and it's okay to feel hurt, angry, and confused. You're not being \"ideological\" or \"rigid\" just because you expect people to respect your identity and well-being. It's actually a sign of strength that you're standing up for yourself and your community.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you didn't do anything wrong by telling your friend that their views are problematic. You had every right to express your concerns and feelings, just like anyone else would. And honestly, it's not about being friends with someone who doesn't accept you \u2013 it's about finding people who respect and love you for who you are.\n\nAs for your friend, I want to suggest that maybe he needs some education on why his views are harmful and how they can affect trans and non-binary individuals like yourself. Maybe you could have a calm and respectful conversation with him, explaining how his words land and the impact it has. It's not about \"winning\" an argument or changing his mind overnight \u2013 it's about fostering empathy and understanding.\n\nLastly, remember that you don't have to deal with this on your own. You can reach out to other friends who are supportive of you, or even seek professional help if you're feeling overwhelmed. You deserve to be surrounded by people who make you feel seen, heard, and loved \u2013 and I'm here to remind you that you are worthy of all those things.\n\nTake care of yourself, friend."
