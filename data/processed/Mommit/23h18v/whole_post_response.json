      "content": "Homicidal Thoughts About My Newborn, Is This Normal?\n\nRecently, I've been having some low moments during the day, but it's only been the last 2 days where I've found myself waking up in tears after dreaming about killing my newborn son. The first night I dreamt I was stuffing all sorts of fabric objects down his throat and watched him suffocate. The second night I dreamt he was restrained on a metal table, and I watched him being tortured with knives, cut all over his body and he was just screaming. I'm ashamed to be dreaming this sort of thing especially since I've recently become a Mum, and I'd never EVER hurt him. It kills me to know I've been dreaming that and I'm going to speak to my GP about this because I am convinced that this is not normal and there's something severely wrong with me mentally. Any help/advice? I'm desperate to resolve this.."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly distressing, frightening, and painful. I want to start by acknowledging the immense courage it took for you to share this. Please know that you are not alone, and the fact that you are so horrified and ashamed by these dreams is powerful evidence that you are a loving parent who would never harm your child.\n\nIt is completely understandable why you feel desperate and think something is severely wrong, but what you are experiencing is a known, treatable symptom that occurs in the postpartum period.\n\n***\n\n### Immediate Steps and Safety Resources\n\nSince you are experiencing severe distress and frightening intrusive thoughts, it is essential that you have access to immediate support, even before your GP appointment.\n\n**If you feel you are in immediate danger of harming yourself or your child, please call emergency services right away.**\n\nIf you need to talk to someone immediately and confidentially about your distress:\n\n| Resource | Service | Contact |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (US)** | Call or Text 24/7 | **988** |\n| **Crisis Text Line** | Text 24/7 | Text **HOME** to **741741** |\n| **Postpartum Support International (PSI)** | Helpline (Trained volunteers specializing in maternal mental health) | Call or Text **1-800-944-4773 (4PPD)** |\n\n***\n\n### Understanding Intrusive Thoughts and Dreams\n\nWhat you are describing\u2014the terrifying, violent thoughts or dreams about harming your baby, accompanied by intense guilt and fear\u2014are professionally known as **intrusive thoughts**.\n\n1.  **They are common:** While the content is horrifying, intrusive thoughts related to harm are extremely common in new parents (up to 91% of new mothers experience them).\n2.  **They are usually a symptom of anxiety/PPD:** These thoughts are often associated with Postpartum Anxiety (PPA) or Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (POCD), which can occur alongside or instead of Postpartum Depression (PPD).\n3.  **The key difference is distress:** The hallmark of these thoughts being a symptom (rather than a genuine threat) is the **extreme distress, guilt, and fear** they cause you. People who genuinely want to harm their children do not experience this level of anguish and shame. Your reaction confirms that these are unwanted, involuntary symptoms.\n4.  **They are not wishes:** These thoughts are the brain\u2019s way of processing intense anxiety, fear of responsibility, and sleep deprivation. They are often called \"ego-dystonic,\" meaning they go against your core values and intentions as a parent.\n\n### Next Steps and What to Tell Your GP\n\nYou are doing the absolute right thing by planning to speak to your GP. Please do not minimize what you are experiencing.\n\nWhen you speak to your doctor, be direct and honest about the content of the dreams and the level of distress they are causing you. You can use terms like:\n\n*   \"I am experiencing severe anxiety and low mood.\"\n*   \"I am having recurring, violent, intrusive thoughts and nightmares about harming my baby.\"\n*   \"I am terrified of these thoughts, and I need help. I believe I am experiencing symptoms of a perinatal mood and anxiety disorder (PMAD).\"\n\nYour GP will likely screen you for PPD/PPA/POCD and discuss treatment options, which typically involve one or a combination of the following:\n\n1.  **Therapy:** Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) are highly effective for managing intrusive thoughts.\n2.  **Medication:** Antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications can significantly reduce the frequency and intensity of these thoughts.\n3.  **Sleep Management:** Severe sleep deprivation can worsen these symptoms; addressing sleep hygiene is often part of the treatment plan.\n\nPlease hold onto the knowledge that this is treatable, and you will feel better. Your current distress is a sign that your brain needs support, not that you are a bad mother. You have taken the first, hardest step by reaching out. Keep going and utilize those support resources immediately."
