      "content": "Did I make a huge mistake\n\nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (29f) moved in together awhile ago with my two young children. I moved to his city for a job that pays pretty well. Like well over $5000 a month. I planned to pay off a lot of my debt and get my kids and I a lot of fun stuff we\u2019ve always been wanting. After a few weeks though my boyfriend stopped waking up in Time for work. He claims he just can\u2019t wake up. He has no idea why except he stays up till 2 am playing video games and watching tv every night. No different than before we lived together. After awhile he was making no money cuz he was just skipping work days. We decided he would just quit bc he got into a web dev program that\u2019s supposed to be done in 9 months. I was happy at first because I figured I\u2019d have more time to spend with him. But he won\u2019t wake up. He says he \u201ccant\u201d wake up. If he agrees to take my son to school in the morning I have to set an alarm to wake up myself wake up my son and get him ready and then I have to wake my boyfriend up because \u201che cant\u201d supposedly even though he had no trouble at all before we moved in together. Meanwhile I have been footing his outrageous bills. I have two kids and my bills are nil. His are over $1000 a month. Which I\u2019m fine with but he stays in bed till I wake him up and I have to repeatedly do so. He watches my kids over the weekend while I work nightshift 6pm to 7am. I don\u2019t get home till 8/830 every morning and I\u2019m exhausted. I come home to an absolute disaster in my home and my young child being up for hours without supervision bc he will not get out of bed. I\u2019ve worked really hard to get where I am and I work tirelessly to keep it nice and tidy in our home but he hardly lifts a finger. When he\u2019s with us, he\u2019s on his phone. He plays with my kids sometimes. But for the most part he\u2019s lost in his phone. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked him to help more around the house bc I\u2019m tired as hell and physically my body is breaking from all the work. But nothing has changed at all. I think that if I work 40+ hours, do all the housework and most of the parenting, then he can do 20 hours of school, an equal amount of housework and parenting but evidently that\u2019s too much to ask of him? According to him he \u201ccleans a lot\u201d but I don\u2019t see it. There\u2019s trash everywhere, unfinished food sitting out, piles of unfolded laundry, dirty floors, full sink no matter how much I do, I feel like I\u2019m just being shit on at every turn. There\u2019s a lot more issues but this is the main one. I have a two year contract at my company and he watches my kids or else I wouldn\u2019t be making as much money. I\u2019m only 6 months in to the job and I want out, I want to go back to being just me and my boys."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly exhausting and frustrating, and it's completely understandable why you are feeling this way and questioning your decision. You are carrying an immense burden right now\u2014financially, physically, and emotionally.\n\nFirst, I want to address your core question: **\"Did I make a huge mistake?\"**\n\nWhat you did was make a significant life choice based on hope, love, and a desire to build a better future, both for yourself and your children. That is not a mistake. A mistake is not realizing when the situation you hoped for is not the reality you are living in. What you are experiencing now is the realization that the arrangement you made is not working, and your partner is not meeting you halfway. That is a painful realization, but it doesn't mean your initial intent was flawed.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what you\u2019ve shared, because there are several critical issues here:\n\n### 1. Financial and Responsibility Imbalance\n\n*   **You are the sole provider:** You are working 40+ hours a week in a high-paying job you moved cities for.\n*   **You are footing his bills:** He has over $1000 in monthly bills that you are covering.\n*   **His \"job\" (school) is not being prioritized:** He is supposed to be in a 9-month program but is having trouble waking up even for that, suggesting his commitment might be low.\n\n**The reality check:** You are supporting a 27-year-old man who is not contributing financially and is barely contributing domestically. He is living off your hard work and high income.\n\n### 2. Domestic and Parenting Imbalance\n\n*   **The Weekend Disaster:** You work grueling night shifts (6 PM to 7 AM) and come home to an \"absolute disaster,\" a full sink, trash everywhere, and, most critically, a young child unsupervised for hours because he won't get out of bed.\n*   **The \"Can't Wake Up\" Excuse:** His inability to wake up seems highly selective (it didn't happen before you moved in, and he manages to stay up until 2 AM). This behavior is impacting your ability to function and, dangerously, the safety and supervision of your children.\n*   **Unequal Effort:** You are working 40+ hours, doing all the housework, and most of the parenting. He is doing 20 hours of school (maybe), minimal housework, and is constantly distracted by his phone.\n\nYou are right: your calculation that he should be able to manage 20 hours of school plus an equal share of household and parenting duties is **absolutely reasonable.** His current output is unacceptable.\n\n### 3. The Contract and Childcare Dilemma\n\nThis is the key logistical hurdle you are facing:\n\n> I have a two year contract at my company and he watches my kids or else I wouldn\u2019t be making as much money. I\u2019m only 6 months in to the job and I want out, I want to go back to being just me and my boys.\n\nYou feel trapped because his role as the weekend/night shift childcare provider is enabling your high income.\n\n---\n\n## What Support Do You Need Right Now?\n\nIt sounds like you are at a breaking point and need to figure out how to reclaim your life and sanity. To help you best, we can focus on a few areas.\n\nWould you like to discuss:\n\n1.  **Immediate action steps** regarding the lack of help and the childcare/work situation?\n2.  **How to communicate** your dissatisfaction and boundaries to him?\n3.  **Logistics of ending the relationship** given your contract and your need for childcare?\n\nIt might be helpful to start with the logistics, as that is what is keeping you feeling stuck.\n\n**What are your options for alternative childcare if he were not in the picture?** For example, what is the cost of a babysitter for the hours you work your night shift, and how does that compare to the money you are currently spending supporting him ($1000+ per month, plus the cost of his neglect)?\n\nYou are not being \"shit on\"\u2014you are being taken advantage of by someone who is prioritizing his comfort over your well-being, your children's safety, and the stability of your shared home. We can work through this."
