      "content": "My mom kissed LO in front of me and denied it & physically touches him too much (imo). How serious is this?\n\nI told my mom explicitly many times to not kiss my baby (4 months old) for hygiene purposes and it also just grosses me out. I have many bad memories of her making me kiss her on the cheek and lips and it makes me feel so so gross because I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice when I was little (and I didn\u2019t want to). She also used to tickle and bite me a lot, she literally chased me around the house and did this to me on her bed and I screamed for my brother to help me get away but my mom took it all as a big joke and didn\u2019t stop until I was old enough to physically stop her. She is a school superintendent (for little kids) so I always figured she was right to do this to me (obviously she wasn\u2019t). \n\nAs LO gets older I\u2019ve stated noticing more concerning things she does. She seems to be getting more confident about her actions. Yesterday she was sitting with my baby and she kissed him on the top of his head. I was shocked and immediately said something like \u2018you cannot kiss LO, you just kissed him\u2019 and she said \u2018no I didn\u2019t\u2019 and acted all surprised. She also started to poke and tickle him and when I told her to stop, she asked why, I explained (bc even though he\u2019s a baby he probably does not enjoy that; he just can\u2019t control his arms enough to swat her away) and she rolled her eyes and disagreed but she did stop. \n\nHow seriously should I take all of this? Am I just being an overly cautious FTM? She\u2019s also made comments in front of me about biting his legs, and when I told her she can never do that she told my infant son that mommy needs to leave him alone with grandma for a while. \n\nI\u2019m huge on consent and always ask my son if I may kiss him on the belly or cheek before I do. I say the same thing \u2018May I give you a kiss?\u2019 and he knows what it means and usually smiles big and giggles, and if he ever doesn\u2019t enthusiastically smile when I ask, I don\u2019t kiss him. Some people laugh at me but I believe babies really can communicate this way. \n\nUp until these comments and kiss, she was our only trusted babysitter. But now I don\u2019t want to leave LO alone with her anymore. Am I overreacting? Is a kiss on the head no big deal if LO Is already 4 months old/is this it\u2019s normal grandma behavior?\n\nETA She is amazing with LO otherwise, he smiles bigger when he sees her than when he sees me. He\u2019s obsessed with her. These physical oversteps just started within the last week (he\u2019s 4 months old) so I don\u2019t know if he understands or cares."

      "content": "I hear how much you are struggling with this situation, and it sounds incredibly stressful and confusing. It takes a lot of courage to reach out and articulate these concerns, especially when they involve your own mother and difficult past experiences.\n\nIt is completely understandable why you are feeling this way and why you are questioning how serious this is. Let's break down the different elements you've shared.\n\n## Addressing Your Concerns and Questions\n\n### 1. How serious is this?\n\nYou are asking a very important question. Based on everything you've described, **this is serious enough to warrant immediate boundary setting and changes in how you interact with your mother regarding your son.**\n\nHere\u2019s why:\n\n*   **Boundary Violation and Disrespect:** You have explicitly and repeatedly told your mother not to kiss your baby for hygiene reasons and personal comfort. Her choice to do it anyway, *in front of you*, is a direct act of disrespecting your role as the parent and disrespecting the boundaries you have set for your child's health and body.\n*   **The Denial and Gaslighting:** When you called her out on the kiss, she denied it and acted surprised. This is a form of gaslighting\u2014making you doubt your own perception of reality. This is particularly concerning because it mirrors the lack of choice and refusal to respect your feelings that you experienced as a child (e.g., the forced kissing, the tickling/biting that was treated as a joke).\n*   **The History of Physical Oversteps:** Your past experiences (forced kissing, unwanted tickling/biting that was dismissed as a joke) provide a crucial context. These memories are not just \"bad memories\"; they are evidence of a pattern where your mother prioritized her own desires (to play, to show affection in her way) over your distress, comfort, and autonomy. This history makes her current behavior much more concerning.\n*   **Dismissing Your Parenting Choices:** Her eye-rolling when you explained why she shouldn't poke/tickle him, her disagreement, and her comment about \"mommy needs to leave him alone with grandma\" are all attempts to undermine your authority and dismiss your philosophy on consent and bodily autonomy, which she knows is important to you.\n\n**In short: You are not being an overly cautious FTM. You are being a protective parent who is setting necessary boundaries based on past patterns and current disrespectful behavior.**\n\n### 2. Is a kiss on the head no big deal / Is this normal grandma behavior?\n\nWhile a kiss on the head might be an innocuous gesture from some people, **in the context of your relationship, explicit instructions, and her denial, it is a big deal.**\n\n*   **Normal Behavior vs. Boundary Breaching:** Many grandmothers kiss their grandchildren. However, when a parent explicitly says \"do not kiss my baby,\" and the grandmother does it anyway and then lies about it, it stops being \"normal grandma behavior\" and becomes a boundary breach and a trust issue.\n*   **The \"Biting\" Comments:** Her comments about biting his legs, even if meant as a joke, coupled with her history of unwanted biting/tickling, are highly concerning because they indicate a continued lack of respect for the child's body and the parent's rules.\n\n### 3. The Issue of Consent and Autonomy\n\nYour focus on consent, even with a four-month-old, is admirable and absolutely valid. You are teaching your child that their body belongs to them and that affection should be enthusiastically given and received.\n\nYour mother's actions (forcing physical interaction, denying her actions, rolling her eyes) stand in direct opposition to the values you are trying to instill. By denying the kiss, she is teaching you (and eventually, your son) that she is above the rules and that she will lie to get what she wants.\n\n### 4. What Does This Mean for Babysitting?\n\nYou asked if you are overreacting by not wanting to leave LO alone with her anymore.\n\n**Absolutely not. You are listening to your gut.**\n\nTrust is the foundation of leaving your child with someone. Your mother has demonstrated two critical things that erode that trust:\n\n1.  **She will knowingly violate your explicit rules.**\n2.  **She will lie about it afterward.**\n\nIf she is willing to violate a hygiene rule and lie about it, what other rules is she willing to break when you aren't there? You have every right to remove her as a sole caregiver until, and unless, she can prove she respects your boundaries and rules.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps and Support\n\nSince you are looking for support on how to handle this, here are some practical steps to consider:\n\n### A. Establish Clear, Firm Boundaries (The \"Shine\")\n\nYou need to shift from explaining *why* (which she ignores) to stating *what* the consequences are for violating the rules.\n\n1.  **The New Rules:** State the rules simply and clearly.\n    *   \"Mom, the rules about LO's physical interaction are non-negotiable. No kissing, no tickling, and no comments about biting. If you forget or ignore these rules, we will need to leave immediately.\"\n2.  **The Consequence (The \"Shine\"):**\n    *   **If she breaks a boundary while you are present (e.g., kisses him or makes a biting comment):** Immediately pick up your baby, state calmly, \"Mom, you broke the rule. We are leaving now,\" and exit the house. Do not engage in an argument or explanation.\n    *   **If she tries to deny it:** Do not engage in the debate. \"I saw what happened, and we are leaving.\"\n3.  **The Babysitting Pause:** You need a definite pause on solo babysitting. You can tell her, \"I need to take a break from having anyone babysit until I feel 100% comfortable with the boundaries being respected. We can only visit when I am present.\"\n\n### B. Prioritize Your Emotional Well-being\n\nIt is traumatic when past hurts are triggered by current events involving your child. It is highly recommended that you:\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Link:** Recognize that her current actions are triggering your childhood trauma (feeling gross, feeling like you have no choice). This is a valid and powerful reason to protect your son fiercely.\n*   **Seek Support:** Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor. They can help you process the childhood experiences and give you tools to manage the anxiety and guilt that often come with setting boundaries with family members.\n\nYour primary job is to protect your baby and model healthy boundaries and consent. You are doing a wonderful job of recognizing the red flags and advocating for your son, even when it\u2019s difficult. Trust your instincts\u2014they are telling you the truth."
