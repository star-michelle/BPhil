As soon as he (20 months)  wakes up I get a smack in the face, holding him and he is all sunshine and rainbows and then suddenly *smack* or he violently grabs my glasses off my face and throws them. He demands to be held and then headbutts me in the nose and grins like he has done some wonder thing. \nAll day I'm just getting beaten up by this kid and I'm starting to really have trouble dealing with it, especially because it's just me he does this too. \n\nMy partner and I don't know what to do. We have been as gentle as possible, we tell him it's not ok to hit me. I put him down or walk away from him as soon as he does it. I've grabbed his hand mid air to stop him and tell him not to. \n\nAnyone else going through this? \nPlease send help!!"

      "content": "It sounds like you are going through an incredibly tough and exhausting time right now, and I want to start by validating just how draining and frustrating this must be for you. It is completely understandable that you are having trouble dealing with it\u2014feeling constantly \"beaten up\" by your own child is a painful and confusing experience, especially when it seems to be directed mostly at you.\n\nYou are definitely not alone in this. This pattern of hitting, grabbing, and headbutting is very common for children around 20 months old, even though it feels completely random and upsetting to the receiving parent.\n\nI can offer some insights into **why** this is happening and some strategies that might help you and your partner navigate this stage.\n\n***\n\n## Understanding the \"Why\" (The 20-Month Perspective)\n\nAt 20 months, your son isn't hitting you out of malice or spite. He is hitting because of a few key developmental factors:\n\n1.  **Communication Gap:** He has huge feelings (frustration, excitement, overstimulation, tiredness) but very few words to express them. Physical actions become his primary language. A \"smack\" might mean, \"I'm excited to see you,\" \"I'm tired,\" \"I want your attention right now,\" or \"I don't like how this feels.\"\n2.  **Impulse Control is Zero:** The part of his brain responsible for stopping an impulse (like raising a hand or grabbing glasses) is still extremely undeveloped. He feels the urge and acts on it instantly.\n3.  **Cause and Effect Exploration:** He is learning about the world. He hits you, and you have a big reaction (you put him down, you walk away, you grab his hand, you say \"No!\"). This reaction is powerful feedback that teaches him this action gets a guaranteed response from you\u2014which is often the goal, even if the action is negative.\n4.  **\"Testing\" Attachment:** The fact that he mostly does this to you suggests he feels safest and most securely attached to you. He knows that no matter how hard he pushes your boundaries, your love and presence will remain. This is a sign of a strong attachment, even though it manifests in very painful ways.\n\nThe headbutting and grinning are often a sign that he is getting a rush from the physical sensation and the big reaction it causes, or he is genuinely pleased he managed to get your full attention focused on him.\n\n***\n\n## Strategies to Try\n\nIt sounds like you are already doing the right thing by being gentle and using consequences like walking away. The key now is consistency and focusing on teaching him **what to do instead** of just what **not** to do.\n\n### 1. The Immediate Response (When the Hit Happens)\n\nThe goal here is to be consistent, immediate, and as calm as possible to avoid giving the \"big reaction\" he is seeking.\n\n*   **Be a \"Wall\" (Not a Reactor):** As soon as the hit happens, respond with a calm, firm voice and minimal eye contact for a moment.\n*   **Use Clear, Simple Language:** \"Hands are not for hitting. Hitting hurts Mama.\" Use only 5-6 words. Avoid long lectures or asking \"Why did you do that?\"\n*   **Immediate Separation (Briefly):** Gently put him down (if you are holding him) or step away. This separation is the consequence.\n    *   *Example:* He smacks you in the face while you are holding him. You immediately and gently put him down, look at him, and say, \"Hitting hurts. Mama needs space.\" Then, turn your back for 10\u201315 seconds.\n*   **Redirect to a \"Safe\" Action:** Once the brief separation is over, immediately redirect his hands to a positive action.\n    *   \"If you are mad, you can hit the pillow.\"\n    *   \"If you want my attention, use your gentle hands [demonstrate touching your arm gently].\"\n\n### 2. Teaching Alternatives (Proactive Strategies)\n\nThis is the most important part\u2014teaching him how to use his body and hands appropriately.\n\n*   **Teach \"Gentle Hands\" Constantly:** Practice this when he is calm. Take his hand and gently stroke your cheek, saying, \"Gentle hands for Mama.\" Do this with stuffed animals, too: \"Gentle hands pet the bear.\"\n*   **Provide Acceptable Physical Outlets:** Since he has a lot of physical energy and impulse, give him things he *can* hit, squeeze, or throw.\n    *   Designate a \"hitting pillow\" or a punching bag toy.\n    *   Keep a basket of soft sensory balls he can throw in a designated area.\n    *   Use rough-housing time with your partner (who is less of a target) to let him release energy safely (e.g., wrestling on the floor).\n*   **Language for Feelings:** Start labeling his feelings for him, which helps bridge the communication gap.\n    *   \"I see you are feeling **FRUSTRATED** because the block fell down.\"\n    *   \"You are **EXCITED** to see Mama! Let's give a gentle hug.\"\n\n### 3. Dealing with the Glasses/Headbutting\n\n*   **Glasses Grabbing:** This is often a game for him. If he grabs them, the immediate consequence must be that the game ends and your attention goes away (briefly). You might need to wear contacts or switch to a less-accessible pair of glasses for a few weeks to break the habit.\n*   **Headbutting:** This is often a sign of high excitement or overstimulation. When he demands to be held, try to preempt the headbutt by creating a boundary. Hold him facing out, or hold him gently but firmly away from your face, saying, \"I'm holding you, but we need gentle bodies.\" If he headbutts, put him down immediately: \"Ouch. Bodies need to be gentle when we hold.\"\n\n***\n\n**A Note on Support for You:**\n\nThis is emotionally taxing. It's important that your partner steps up to be the primary support for you right now.\n\n*   **Partner Intervention:** If your son hits you, your partner should be the one to step in and manage the consequence (putting him down/separating) while you take a very quick break. This shows your son that the boundary is universal, and it gives you a moment to recover.\n*   **Take Breaks:** Schedule short periods (even 15 minutes) where your partner is 100% responsible for him so you can truly step away and regulate your own feelings.\n\nHang in there. This is a phase, and while it feels endless now, consistent, calm redirection will eventually help him develop the tools he needs to communicate without hitting. You are doing a great job seeking help and trying every approach possible."
