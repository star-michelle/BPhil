I have never in my life experience what I\u2019ve gone through in the past eight days with this \u201cmorning sickness\u201d. I honestly would rather have Covid again. The nausea has been nonstop from morning to night along with my entire body feeling like it just got over an intense sunburn. Recently found a morning sickness pill that has helped somewhat but I still feel horrible throughout the entire day. I only drink water and ginger ale ( saw a website that recommended it) and I\u2019ve been avoiding any type of greasy or grilled food. \n\nI have a doctors appointment on Friday for something else so hopefully they can prescribe me something then but until then can anybody recommend anything please."

      "content": "I am so sorry you are going through this. What you are describing sounds absolutely grueling, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you feel like you are barely hanging on. Dealing with severe, nonstop nausea while caring for a two-year-old is an incredibly difficult challenge.\n\nIt's good that you have a doctor's appointment scheduled for Friday\u2014that is definitely the right step to take to get stronger prescription help.\n\nIn the meantime, since you are looking for things you can try between now and Friday, here are several non-prescription suggestions that have helped others in similar situations. Please remember I am not a doctor, and these are complementary suggestions to discuss with your healthcare provider.\n\n***\n\n### Immediate Relief and Management\n\nGiven that you are already avoiding greasy foods and drinking water/ginger ale, here are some ways to manage the nausea and the unusual \"sunburn\" feeling:\n\n#### 1. Dietary Adjustments (The \"BRAT\" and \"Small & Often\" Approach)\n\n*   **Focus on Bland and Dry:** Instead of trying to force yourself to eat full meals, focus on tiny, frequent snacks of very bland foods.\n    *   **B**ananas\n    *   **R**ice (plain white rice)\n    *   **A**pplesauce\n    *   **T**oast (dry or with a little jam, avoiding butter)\n    *   **Other options:** Saltine crackers, plain pretzels, dry cereal (like Cheerios), plain baked potato.\n*   **Keep Your Stomach Slightly Full:** An empty stomach often makes nausea worse. Try to have a few crackers *before* you even get out of bed in the morning. Keep a stash right next to your bed.\n*   **Temperature Matters:** Sometimes, cold foods are easier to tolerate than warm ones. Try popsicles, frozen fruit (like grapes), or simple ice chips.\n*   **Protein is Key (When you can manage it):** While carbs are often the easiest to tolerate, protein can help stabilize blood sugar, which sometimes reduces nausea. Try small bites of cold chicken (if tolerated) or sip on bone broth.\n\n#### 2. Managing the Nausea (Beyond Ginger Ale)\n\n*   **Lemon/Citrus Scents:** Some people find that sniffing fresh lemon slices, lemon essential oil, or even just sucking on a lemon drop can provide a temporary distraction or relief from the nausea.\n*   **Peppermint:** Peppermint tea or peppermint candies can also sometimes help settle the stomach.\n*   **Acupressure Bands:** Look for Sea-Bands or similar wristbands (often found in pharmacies or travel sections). These apply pressure to a point on the inside of your wrist (the P6 point) that is traditionally used to treat motion sickness and nausea. They are safe to use 24/7.\n*   **Hydration Strategy:** Sip, don't gulp. Drinking too much water at once can slosh around and trigger nausea. Take very small sips constantly throughout the day.\n\n#### 3. Addressing the \"Sunburn\" Sensation (Potential Paresthesia/Sensitivity)\n\nThe full-body feeling of being intensely sunburned is unusual and needs to be mentioned to your doctor on Friday. It might be related to hormonal changes, extreme dehydration, or nerve sensitivity.\n\n*   **Cool Compresses/Lukewarm Baths:** Try taking lukewarm or slightly cool baths/showers. If a full bath is too much effort, try applying cool, damp washcloths to areas that feel most sensitive (like the back of your neck or forehead).\n*   **Loose, Soft Clothing:** Wear only the absolute softest, loosest clothing you own. Avoid anything with tight seams, rough fabrics, or restrictive waistbands.\n*   **Moisturize:** While it may seem counterintuitive for a \"sunburn\" feeling that isn't sunburn, applying a very gentle, unscented lotion might soothe the skin barrier.\n\n***\n\n### Practical Survival Tactics for the Next Few Days\n\nSince you have a two-year-old, the physical demands are huge. Lower your expectations dramatically for the next few days.\n\n*   **Embrace Screen Time/Independent Play:** If your child is safe and contained, let them watch extra TV or play independently on the floor near you. Survival is the only goal right now.\n*   **Ask for Help, Immediately:** Is there a partner, friend, parent, or neighbor who can take the two-year-old for an hour or two? Even 30 minutes of uninterrupted rest in a dark, quiet room can help reset your system slightly.\n*   **Rest When the Child Rests:** Forget chores. When your two-year-old naps or has quiet time, you must rest, even if you can't sleep. Lying down helps reduce the energy expenditure.\n*   **Keep a Vomit Bag/Bucket Nearby:** Having a designated place right next to you can reduce anxiety if you feel the urge suddenly, which sometimes helps manage the nausea psychologically.\n\nHang in there. What you are experiencing is likely Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG) or a very severe form of morning sickness, and it is a medical condition, not just a normal part of pregnancy. **Be very direct with your doctor on Friday about the severity**\u2014tell them you are unable to function and feel worse than you did with COVID. This will help ensure they prescribe something strong enough, likely a combination of medications.\n\nYou are doing an amazing job just getting through each hour. Focus only on the next small step until Friday."
