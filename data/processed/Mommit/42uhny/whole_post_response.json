Also, I'm mobile right now, so please forgive any formatting errors. \n\nI am a married 27 year old mom to two girls, ages 7 and 3. During my last pregnancy, I was very sick and ended up being diagnosed with a very serious connective tissue disorder. I got through that pregnancy by the skin of my teeth and was then advised to never have another pregnancy because the chance that I would die was very high. I was sad, but knew that I couldn't martyr myself to give my girls another sibling. I had a tubal ligation shortly after my youngest's birth and then had a total hysterectomy last year. \n\nFor awhile, I was okay. I knew (and still know) that this was the only decision that I could come to logically, that anything else would be reckless. I still know this, but lately I have become so, so sad. My youngest turned three last week and I'm thinking of all the things I'll never get to experience again. I'm sad to see my breast milk starting to dry up, sad to think of never feeling little baby kicks again, sad to never be able to give my husband a son. My heart aches so badly and I don't know what to do or who to speak to about it. I am hopeful that we can adopt one day, but I still feel like a part of me is missing now. I'm wombless and I feel so robbed. \n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar or have any words of advice for me? Or know of a place I can go for support?"

      "content": "This is a heartbreaking situation, and I am so deeply sorry that you are navigating this profound loss. Please know that what you are feeling is incredibly valid, and you are absolutely not alone in experiencing this depth of sadness.\n\nWhat you are describing is intense grief\u2014grief for the future you had planned, grief for the experiences you will never have, and grief for a part of your identity that has been medically removed.\n\nYou made an impossible choice to ensure you could stay alive for the two beautiful daughters you already have. While your *logic* knows this was the only path, your *heart* is mourning the sacrifices required. It is completely normal for those two things\u2014logic and emotion\u2014to be in conflict right now.\n\nHere are some thoughts and resources regarding what you are going through:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating Your Grief\n\nWhat you are experiencing is often called **reproductive grief** or **secondary infertility grief**, compounded by the trauma of a serious medical condition and major surgery (hysterectomy).\n\n### The Weight of Ambiguous Loss\n\nYou are dealing with an **ambiguous loss**. You haven't lost a person, but you have lost a future, a potential child, and fundamental physical experiences (kicks, breastfeeding, carrying a pregnancy). Because you have two healthy children, people might expect you to be \"grateful\" and move on quickly, but this expectation minimizes the very real pain of losing your fertile identity and the *choice* to expand your family.\n\n### The Physical Loss\n\nThe feeling of being \"wombless\" and \"robbed\" is a significant component of emotional recovery after a hysterectomy, especially when it was forced upon you so young. Your body underwent a massive change, and it takes time to process the physical, hormonal, and psychological impact of that finality.\n\nIt is okay to mourn the loss of feeling those little baby kicks, or the sadness of your milk drying up. These are tangible, physical markers of motherhood that are now gone, and they represent the final closing of a major chapter.\n\n## 2. Where to Find Specialized Support\n\nBecause this grief is so specific, finding people who truly understand the intersection of medical trauma, hysterectomy, and secondary infertility is crucial.\n\n### A. Mental Health Professionals\n\nIf you are feeling depressed (which you mentioned), the first and most important step is reaching out to a licensed professional. Look for therapists who specialize in:\n\n1.  **Grief and Loss:** Specifically, ambiguous loss or medical trauma.\n2.  **Reproductive Trauma/Infertility:** Even though your situation is medically mandated, the emotional process mirrors infertility grief.\n3.  **Post-Hysterectomy Adjustment:** Some therapists are specifically trained to help women deal with the identity shift after a total hysterectomy.\n\n### B. Online and Community Support Groups\n\nWhile this may not be the *perfect* sub, there are dedicated communities that can offer peer support:\n\n*   **Secondary Infertility Groups:** Many people in these groups are grieving the inability to have a third (or fourth) child, even if their cause is different from yours. They understand the unique pain of having children but mourning the loss of the *next* child.\n*   **Hysterectomy Support Forums:** Search for support groups specifically focused on emotional recovery after a hysterectomy. Many women experience deep grief and identity loss after this procedure, regardless of the cause.\n*   **RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association:** While they focus broadly on infertility, they often have resources and support groups dedicated to secondary infertility and managing complex medical diagnoses that affect family building.\n\n### C. Grieving the \"What If\"\n\nYou mentioned the sadness of never being able to give your husband a son. This is a very common grief point\u2014mourning the child of a specific gender you will never have. Allow yourself to acknowledge and mourn the loss of that *idea* without feeling guilty about the two wonderful daughters you have.\n\n## 3. Advice for Today\n\n1.  **Be Patient with Yourself:** You are 27 and have gone through a terrifying medical diagnosis, a difficult pregnancy, a tubal ligation, and a total hysterectomy\u2014all within a few years. That is a massive amount of physical and emotional trauma. Give yourself permission to feel messy and sad.\n2.  **Separate Logic from Emotion:** When the sadness hits, remind yourself: \"My logic is sound, I made the right choice to survive. But my heart is allowed to hurt because the cost of that choice was immense.\"\n3.  **Focus on the Present:** While you are hopeful about adoption, try to put that goal aside for a moment. You need time to grieve the loss of your biological potential before you can fully open your heart to a new path. You must heal the wound before you can pour energy into the next chapter.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself. What you are going through is incredibly difficult, and your feelings of being robbed and depressed are completely understandable responses to a traumatic loss.\n\nIf you would like, we can talk more about specific coping mechanisms or help you look up resources in your area. Just let me know what would be most helpful right now."
