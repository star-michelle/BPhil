      "content": "I completely lost it tonight \n\nI have an almost 7 week old daughter and for the last couple of weeks, she has been screaming bloody murder around dinner time and beyond. Legitimately inconsolable. She will turn almost purple and sound like she\u2019s not breathing because she\u2019s crying so hard. It will last anywhere from 30 mins to 2 hours. \n\nI don\u2019t know how to keep my calm during these moments. My anxiety immediately spikes to uncontrollable levels. \n\nTonight, I got so frustrated and overwhelmed that I threw a spaghetti-filled bowl (from dinner) as hard as I possibly could onto the kitchen floor and the food splattered everywhere - on the floor and walls. \n\nI truly try as hard as I can to keep my cool but I lost it tonight. Granted, it\u2019s been a hard day. Scratch that, it\u2019s been a hard last 2 months. Having a newborn is so, so hard. There\u2019s no escape. I just want it to get easier\u2026 please tell me it gets easier! "

      "content": "Oh, I hear you. Take a deep breath. What you went through tonight sounds absolutely terrifying and exhausting.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge how incredibly hard this is. You are dealing with an intense, relentless situation\u2014a newborn who is inconsolable for hours at a time\u2014while running on empty after two very difficult months. It is completely understandable that you reached a breaking point tonight.\n\n**What you did was throw a bowl of spaghetti on the floor.** You did not hurt your daughter. You directed your frustration at an inanimate object when you were pushed past your limit. Please, be kind to yourself about that. It was a release of overwhelming, trapped anxiety, and it shows just how much pressure you are under right now.\n\n### Let\u2019s talk about the hard stuff:\n\n**1. The Screaming:**\nThe period you are describing\u2014the evening screaming, the purple face, the inconsolable crying that lasts for hours\u2014is often called \"the witching hour\" or, if severe, it can be related to colic. It hits many babies around this age (6-8 weeks is often the peak) and it is physically and mentally shattering for parents.\n\nI know the sound is terrifying, especially when she sounds like she can\u2019t breathe. You are doing the right thing by trying to soothe her, but it is important to remember: **When she is crying this intensely, it is not a reflection of your ability to parent.** It is a physiological state she is in right now.\n\n**2. Does it get easier?**\n**YES. Absolutely, emphatically, yes, it gets easier.**\n\nThis 6-8 week period is often the absolute hardest time. It is the peak of infant crying, and babies are only just starting to move out of the newborn fog.\n\n*   **Around 3 months (12 weeks):** The intensity of the crying often dramatically decreases. The digestive system matures, the nervous system starts to regulate, and babies become more engaged with the world (meaning they have other ways to express themselves besides crying).\n*   **Around 4 months:** You will likely start to see real smiles, giggles, and some predictable routines. You will feel like you are parenting a tiny human, not just surviving an unpredictable crisis.\n\nYou are in the thick of the hardest part right now, and you are surviving it.\n\n### Immediate Support for You:\n\nYour anxiety spike is a huge signal that you need a safety plan for these moments.\n\nWhen your daughter starts the evening screaming and you feel that overwhelming surge of anxiety and frustration, try this plan:\n\n1.  **Safety Check:** Make sure she is safe (fed, dry, no obvious medical issue).\n2.  **The 10-Minute Rule:** If you feel yourself starting to lose control\u2014if you feel that urge to scream, throw something, or shake\u2014**put the baby down immediately in her crib or bassinet, even if she is screaming.**\n3.  **Step Away:** Walk out of the room. Set a timer for 10 minutes.\n4.  **Regulate:** While you are out of the room, do something that resets your nervous system:\n    *   Put on noise-canceling headphones (even if they are just basic earbuds) to dull the sound.\n    *   Run cold water over your hands or splash it on your face.\n    *   Stare at the spaghetti mess on the floor and tell yourself, \"I am allowed to be angry right now. I am safe. She is safe.\"\n    *   Call or text your partner, a friend, or a family member and tell them, \"I need a tag-out. I am taking a break.\"\n\n**It is okay to let her cry safely in her crib while you calm down.** Your priority in that moment is keeping yourself regulated enough so that you don't hurt yourself or her.\n\n### Is there anything you can do right now to get support?\n\nIs there a partner, family member, or friend who can come over tomorrow or take over for a few hours so you can get a break, even just to clean up the spaghetti in peace?\n\nAnd if you feel like your anxiety is spiking to a point where you might harm yourself or your daughter, please reach out immediately to a crisis line. You are not alone, and these feelings are common when you are exhausted:\n*   **Postpartum Support International (PSI):** Call or text \"Help\" to 800-944-4773 (4PPD)."
