      "content": "I dream about leaving\n\nI keep coming so close to just getting in the car and leaving the kids and their dad behind. I love my husband and my daughter, but I just can\u2019t stand my son. \n\nHe\u2019s 3. He is naughty. He\u2019s my first child so I have no idea if his level of naughty is normal, but I just can\u2019t take it any more. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t respond to punishment, praise, gentle parenting, taking toys away, nothing. Nothing works. It takes hours of him messing around, getting out of bed, jumping on the bed, sometimes hitting us, to get him to go to sleep. \n\nI\u2019m beyond frustrated. I know everyone is going to say it\u2019s not forever, but it might be. My brother has caused endless stress and heartbreak for my parents. I can\u2019t live like that. I don\u2019t think I can even get through and next 7 weeks until he starts preschool. \n\nHis attention span is next to nothing. I know half the time he\u2019s naughty to get attention, but I can\u2019t play with him every second of the day, and why is he after attention when he\u2019s meant to be going to sleep? Is he on the spectrum? I can\u2019t cope with that. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what to do. He\u2019s so rarely sweet that all I see is this horrible child and I wonder what I did wrong to make him that way. How do I fix him? I just want to leave."

      "content": "This sounds absolutely agonizing. I want to start by saying that what you are feeling\u2014the desperation, the exhaustion, the intense frustration, and the powerful urge to just walk away\u2014is a direct result of being pushed past your limit. **You are in a crisis right now, and you are not failing.** You are a parent who is completely depleted and coping with an extremely stressful situation alone.\n\nPlease know that reaching this point of wanting to leave is a sign that you need immediate support, and you deserve that support.\n\nLet\u2019s take this one step at a time.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Safety and Immediate Support\n\nThe thoughts you are having about leaving are serious, and they are a clear sign of emotional burnout and exhaustion. **You need to prioritize getting relief and support today.**\n\n1.  **Talk to Your Husband:** Even if it\u2019s difficult, tell him exactly how close you are to leaving. You need him to step in and take over primary child management for a significant period immediately so you can rest and regain perspective.\n2.  **Reach Out to a Friend or Family Member:** Can anyone take your son for an afternoon, or even an hour, so you can have uninterrupted time alone?\n3.  **Contact a Professional:** What you are describing is overwhelming, and it is crucial to get professional support for yourself right now. If you are feeling unsafe or truly think you might leave, please reach out to a crisis line immediately. They can provide immediate, compassionate support and resources.\n\n> **In the US, you can call or text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline).** This is a resource for anyone experiencing emotional distress, including parental burnout and crisis.\n\n## 2. Addressing the Behavior and the Frustration\n\nYou are asking if his behavior is normal, if he is on the spectrum, and how to fix him. It is completely understandable why you are asking these questions\u2014you are looking for the root cause of the chaos.\n\n### **The \"Naughty\" Label and the Age of Three**\n\nThree is often called the \"terrible threes\" for a reason. It is an age defined by huge emotional swings, boundary testing, and an inability to regulate big feelings.\n\nHowever, the sheer intensity of the struggles you are describing\u2014especially the hours-long bedtime battles, non-response to all discipline methods, and hitting\u2014suggests that this is beyond typical toddler difficulty. **It means the current methods are not working for his specific needs, not that you are a bad parent or that he is a bad child.**\n\n### **The Spectrum Concern**\n\nIt is impossible to know if he is on the spectrum from a paragraph, but your concerns about his attention span and inability to comply are valid reasons to seek a professional evaluation.\n\n**Please schedule an appointment with his pediatrician as soon as possible.**\n\nDo not frame this as \"I need you to fix him.\" Frame it as:\n\n*   \"We are experiencing severe bedtime resistance (3+ hours nightly).\"\n*   \"He does not respond to any traditional parenting method (praise, punishment, time-outs).\"\n*   \"I am concerned about his attention span and ability to regulate, and I need help determining if we need outside support, such as an occupational therapist or a developmental assessment.\"\n\nGetting a diagnosis, whatever it may be, is not a life sentence; it is a **roadmap**. It gives you specific tools and strategies designed to work with his unique brain, rather than forcing a square peg into a round hole.\n\n### **The Bedtime Battle**\n\nThe bedtime struggle is the most immediate source of your stress. When a child is seeking attention at night, it\u2019s often because they have unmet connection needs during the day, or they have a genuine inability to calm their nervous system down.\n\nFor the next 7 weeks, until preschool starts, you need to go into **survival mode** and reduce the friction at night, even if it feels counterintuitive.\n\n*   **Stop Fighting Compliance:** Fighting for hours is destroying your mental health. If you know he will stay in his room and is safe, lower your standard for \"going to sleep.\" If he jumps on the bed for an hour and then crashes, let him. If you remove the audience (you), you sometimes remove the motivation for the attention-seeking behavior.\n*   **The Power Hour (or 10 Minutes):** Since he seeks attention constantly, try scheduling a dedicated 10\u201315 minutes of 100% focused, uninterrupted, child-led play every day, maybe right before the bedtime routine starts. No phone, no sibling, just him and you. Filling that \"attention bucket\" proactively sometimes reduces the need for negative attention later.\n\n## 3. The Feeling of Failure\n\nYou asked, \"What did I do wrong to make him that way?\"\n\n**The answer is nothing.**\n\nChildren are born with unique temperaments and needs. You did not cause his high needs. You are simply the parent who is currently trying to manage a child whose needs are overwhelming your resources. High-needs children are incredibly challenging, and they often lead parents to feel exactly the way you do.\n\nPlease be compassionate with yourself. You are doing the absolute best you can under circumstances that are crushing you.\n\nYou are overwhelmed, exhausted, and desperately need a break. The first step is acknowledging that you cannot shoulder this burden alone anymore. Please reach out to your husband, a trusted friend, or a helpline right now. We are here to listen further when you are ready."
