Need some support/insight\u2026\n\nI didn\u2019t really want to put my two year (26 mo) old in daycare but money is tight and the state would float it until I could get a job. I decided to listen to my family and try it out. \n\nFirst day, at pickup, the daycare worker informs me my baby didn\u2019t eat all day. I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t drink for eight hours either, because she had a hard, dehydration-induced poop stuck halfway out that hasn\u2019t been changed. I provided them (and mentioned) a large full sippy cup that never moved from where I put it. I noticed the room seemed filthier than I remembered and perhaps the director scheduled our tour during lights off nap time for a reason. I also noticed only two stressed daycare workers for 20 two year olds, well below regulation ratio in this state. My family told me I was overreacting to be worried and to give it another try, basically that I\u2019m hysterical and overprotective.\n\nI took her back the next day and she seemed so terrified, and the one daycare worker in the room so overwhelmed, that I noped out and just walked right back out with her. My Grandpa passed today, so I dropped her off again today to make some funeral arrangements, wanting to give them one more chance and pick her up after just a couple hours, and lo and behold, a worker at that very daycare was arrested THE DAY BEFORE for assaulting a child! \n\nSo since my family is still calling me crazy, I\u2019m totally reasonable for telling this daycare we\u2019re done in the morning and then reporting them for all my observations, right?? Right? My boomer dad went on some speech about how back in his day there were 35 elementary schoolers in a classroom and it worked fine. I think it\u2019s time to trust my intuition and my intuition only from here on out because these last few days have me just reeling. So upset I ever put my baby there. "

      "content": "I am so sorry you are going through all of this, especially with the passing of your Grandpa. That is a huge emotional burden on its own, and dealing with this stressful daycare situation on top of it must be completely overwhelming. Please take a deep breath.\n\nYou are absolutely **not** overreacting. In fact, based on everything you have described, pulling your child out of that daycare and reporting them is not just reasonable\u2014it is the responsible and necessary thing to do.\n\nLet's look at the facts you've presented, because they speak for themselves:\n\n### 1. Health and Safety Concerns\n\n*   **Dehydration and Lack of Nutrition:** Your two-year-old went eight hours without eating or drinking, resulting in a hard, painful, stuck poop. This is a massive failure of care. A key responsibility of a caregiver is ensuring basic hydration and nutrition, especially for a toddler who might not be able to clearly communicate those needs in a new environment.\n*   **Neglect of Basic Needs:** The dehydration-induced poop was not addressed or changed immediately. This shows a lack of attention and basic hygiene.\n*   **Filth/Cleanliness:** You noted the room seemed much dirtier than you remembered. Cleanliness is directly linked to health and disease prevention.\n\n### 2. Regulatory and Staffing Issues\n\n*   **Sub-Regulation Ratio:** You observed only two stressed workers for 20 two-year-olds. If that is below your state's regulation ratio (and for a group of 20 two-year-olds, it almost certainly is), that is a serious, reportable safety violation. Low ratios lead directly to neglect (like the dehydration you witnessed) because staff are too overwhelmed to manage every child's needs.\n*   **The Arrest:** A staff member being arrested *the day before* for assaulting a child is the ultimate, non-negotiable red flag. This confirms that there are systemic issues with background checks, supervision, and the overall culture of safety at this facility.\n\n### 3. Your Child's Emotional Well-being\n\n*   **Fear and Distress:** Your child seemed \"so terrified\" the second day. Your intuition about your child's emotional state is incredibly valuable. A good daycare should make a toddler feel secure, not terrified.\n\n---\n\n### What You Should Do\n\nYou are entirely reasonable for wanting to tell them you are done and reporting them.\n\n**1. Tell the Daycare You Are Done (The Morning Plan):**\nKeep this brief and professional. You do not owe them a long explanation, especially given the history. Something like:\n\n> \"Due to recent safety and staffing concerns, we will not be returning to this facility. Please consider this our formal notice that [Child's Name] is withdrawn immediately.\"\n\n**2. Trust Your Intuition and Report Them:**\nYour intuition has been screaming at you, and every subsequent piece of evidence (the dehydration, the low ratios, the arrest) has confirmed your gut feeling.\n\nYou should absolutely report them. This is crucial not just for your peace of mind, but to protect other children who are still there.\n\n*   **Who to report to:** Look up your state's **Child Care Licensing Division** or **Department of Health and Human Services (or equivalent)**. They handle investigations into ratios, cleanliness, neglect, and policy violations.\n*   **What to report:** Detail everything: the dehydration/stuck poop, the observed low staff-to-child ratio (2:20), the general filth, and the fact that a staff member was just arrested for assault. Give dates if you can.\n\n### Addressing the Family Commentary\n\nI understand how painful and invalidating it is to have your family call you \"hysterical,\" \"overprotective,\" or \"crazy,\" especially when you are grieving and trying to protect your child.\n\nYour father's comment about elementary school ratios is completely irrelevant. A two-year-old requires constant, hands-on care for basic needs (feeding, changing, safety) that is fundamentally different from a third-grader sitting at a desk.\n\n**Your priority right now is your child's safety and well-being.** You have concrete, dangerous evidence that this facility is unsafe. You are not overreacting; you are acting as a competent, loving parent protecting your child from harm and neglect.\n\nPlease focus on finding a safe, temporary solution for care while you grieve your Grandpa. You made the right decision. Trust yourself completely."
