My partner is staying at home with my son for the next 4 months, until he goes to daycare. \n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened, but I now feel completely disconnected from him. \n\nI\u2019m exhausted from doing three feeds a night, working, studying (trying to finish my masters degree), pumping **all the fucking time**.  Now when he sees me he just wants to breastfeed. If he\u2019s near me he\u2019s immediately agitated, pulling my shirt and grabbing my breasts. If I don\u2019t feed him he gets more and more upset and crying. He doesn\u2019t even want to feed, just be attached to me.  I\u2019m always a patient person and I\u2019ve never felt frustrated with him before, but now sometimes I feel so hurt and angry. He\u2019s happy and giggly for everyone else, but with me it\u2019s not like that **at all** anymore. My baby just wants my boob. He can go from perfectly fine to seeing me and wailing in 2 seconds. It\u2019s every single time, every day, and it\u2019s just breaking me.\n\nI feel numb. I know it\u2019s not his fault. I know he wants to be close to me, but I just feel like a source of nutrition. It\u2019s so hard to see him only be my happy boy with his Dad.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I have in-laws staying and you can cut the tension with a knife. It\u2019s not helping hearing about all the little things each day that he\u2019s done and how much fun he was. I know I should be glad, but I feel worse. I feel like I\u2019ve lost something special.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Has anyone been here? Does it get better?"

      "content": "Oh, I am so incredibly sorry you are going through this. Please, take a deep breath. Everything you are feeling\u2014the numbness, the resentment, the exhaustion, the deep hurt\u2014is completely valid and understandable.\n\nYou are not alone in this feeling, and what you are describing is an extremely common, though rarely talked about, reaction to the immense stress and transition you are currently facing.\n\nLet\u2019s break down everything you are juggling right now, because it is an overwhelming amount:\n\n1.  **The Physical Load:** Working, studying for a Masters, pumping constantly, *and* doing three night feeds. This level of chronic sleep deprivation and physical demand alone is enough to make anyone feel numb and angry.\n2.  **The Emotional Transition:** Returning to work after 7 months is a huge shift for both you and your baby. This is a period of intense grief for the time you feel you've lost.\n3.  **The Relationship Stress:** Navigating a tense environment with in-laws while simultaneously feeling compared to your partner\u2019s seemingly easy connection with your son.\n\nYou are currently running on empty, and your brain and body are signaling that you are beyond maxed out.\n\n---\n\n## Understanding the Baby\u2019s Behavior (It\u2019s Not Rejection)\n\nIt is heartbreaking to feel like your baby only wants you for your body, but I want to reframe this for you, because it is crucial:\n\n**Your baby is not rejecting you; he is desperately trying to reconnect and regulate himself after separation.**\n\nWhen you are away, he is learning how to be safe with Dad. When you walk in the room, his little brain goes into overdrive. He is overwhelmed by the excitement of seeing you *and* the stress of the previous separation. Breastfeeding is his fastest, most reliable way to:\n\n1.  **Regulate his emotions:** He sees you, gets overstimulated, and needs the immediate physical comfort and chemical response of nursing to calm down.\n2.  **Re-establish security:** He is ensuring you are fully present. The agitation and shirt-pulling are signs of intense attachment need, not rejection.\n\nThe reason he is happy and giggly with others is because his emotional needs are different with them. They are constant, safe companions, but **you are his primary source of attachment and comfort.** He saves his biggest, most complex feelings\u2014including his stress and neediness\u2014for you. This is a sign of how secure he feels with you, even if it feels exhausting.\n\n---\n\n## What You Can Do Now\n\nThis situation is not sustainable, and something needs to give so you can refuel and reconnect with your son.\n\n### 1. Reduce the Physical Load (Immediate Priority)\n\nYou cannot pour from an empty cup. You must delegate wherever possible:\n\n*   **Night Feeds:** Can your partner take over even one of those three night feeds? Even if it means giving a bottle of pumped milk or formula (if you are open to it). Getting one solid 4\u20135 hour block of sleep can dramatically change your emotional resilience.\n*   **Pumping:** If you are feeling this level of frustration, review your breastfeeding goals. If you need to scale back pumping slightly to save your mental health, that is okay. You are allowed to prioritize your well-being.\n*   **Masters Degree:** Can you defer a semester or take a lighter load? If this is adding significant stress, it might be worth pausing until the family transition settles.\n\n### 2. Reclaim Non-Feeding Connection Time\n\nYou need to break the cycle where your presence immediately equals feeding. This is challenging, but necessary:\n\n*   **The \"Hand-Off\" Strategy:** When you come home, have your partner immediately take the baby (maybe outside, or to another room) for 15-20 minutes while you decompress, change clothes, and maybe have a drink of water. This gives the baby time to process your return without immediate access to the breast.\n*   **Designated \"Cuddle Time\" (Non-Feeding):** Schedule 15 minutes a day where you connect in a way that makes nursing physically impossible. This might be:\n    *   A bath together (skin-to-skin contact, but the environment prevents feeding).\n    *   Reading a book while he is held securely in a carrier or on your lap, with a blanket over your chest.\n    *   Going for a walk in a stroller or carrier (movement can be regulating).\n*   **Change the Scenery:** If you are always feeding in the same chair, try a different spot. Sometimes changing the location can break the association.\n\n### 3. Address the External Stressors\n\nThe in-laws and the tension are draining your reserves.\n\n*   **Set Boundaries on Commentary:** You are allowed to gently change the subject when the commentary about \"how much fun he was with Dad\" starts. A simple, \"That\u2019s wonderful, but I\u2019m too tired to process it right now. How about we talk about [neutral topic] instead?\"\n*   **Prioritize Your Relationship with Your Partner:** Ensure your partner understands that while you are grateful he is home with your son, the transition is breaking you, and you need his active support in delegating tasks and protecting your boundaries.\n\n### 4. Know That It Gets Better\n\n**Yes, it absolutely gets better.**\n\nThis intense neediness and the feeling of being a \"milk machine\" is often temporary, linked directly to the transition back to work and the current developmental stage. As your son gets older, his language and mobility improve, and he finds new ways to regulate his emotions, the intense reliance on the breast for comfort will ease.\n\nYou will start to see your happy, giggly boy again, and you will find your special connection that is separate from feeding.\n\n---\n\n## Please Consider Professional Support\n\nThe feelings you described\u2014feeling **numb**, exhausted, and experiencing intense **anger and frustration**\u2014are common signs of Postpartum Depression or Postpartum Anxiety (PPA/PPD can often manifest as anger rather than sadness).\n\n**You are struggling under an impossible load, and you deserve support.**\n\nPlease reach out to your primary care provider or an obstetrician/midwife. They can screen you and offer resources, whether that is therapy, medication, or simply connecting you with a therapist specializing in maternal mental health.\n\n**Your exhaustion is not a moral failing, and your feelings of anger are a sign that you need help and rest.** Be gentle with yourself. You are doing an incredible job navigating work, school, and motherhood under extremely challenging circumstances."
