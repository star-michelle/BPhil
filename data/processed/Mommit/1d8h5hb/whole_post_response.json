      "content": "Breastfeeding vs antidepressants \n\nI was on 300mg of Wellbutrin as well as a rather high level of xanax up until I found out I was pregnant. Quit cold turkey as soon as I found out it could be harmful to my baby.\n\nNow he's born and a few months old, and I am struggling HARD. The only feelings I seem to have are sadness/despair, anger, or numbness. I know I love my child, but I don't feel love, happiness, joy, or anything like that. My milk supply has dwindled noticeably the two times I have tried to go back on my antidepressants, soI haven't been able to take them.\n\nI feel like I'm being forced to choose between having some modicum of mental stability with my meds, or continuing to pump milk for my child. I want to do what's best for him, but I am absolutely miserable and cry all the time.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\n(Yes, I'm in therapy, but it doesn't feel like it does  anything but make me feel worse)"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to start by acknowledging the immense strength it took for you to share all of this. You are dealing with a complex and painful situation, and the fact that you are actively seeking solutions shows how much you care about both your well-being and your baby's.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you feel forced to choose between mental stability and breastfeeding. This is a common, heartbreaking dilemma for many parents, and the emotional weight of it is immense.\n\nI am here to listen and help you explore your options, but please remember that **I am an AI and not a medical professional.** The information we discuss should be taken to your healthcare providers\u2014specifically the doctor who manages your medication (psychiatrist or PCP) and your baby's pediatrician (or a lactation consultant)\u2014to make a safe and informed decision.\n\nLet's break down the situation and look at the key areas where you need support and information:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Addressing the Mental Health Crisis\n\nThe severity of the symptoms you are describing (sadness/despair, anger, numbness, constant crying, inability to feel joy/love) suggests that you are experiencing a significant mental health crisis, likely Postpartum Depression (PPD) that is being exacerbated by stopping your prior high-dose medication regimen abruptly.\n\n### **Immediate Action Points (To Discuss with Your Doctor):**\n\n**A. Medication Review and Adjustment:**\n\nThe issue might not be *antidepressants* versus *breastfeeding*, but rather finding the **right combination of medication and dosage** that works for you without compromising your supply.\n\n*   **Wellbutrin (Bupropion) and Supply:** Wellbutrin, while very effective for many people, is sometimes associated with lowering milk supply, especially at higher doses (300mg is a high dose).\n*   **Alternative Antidepressants:** There are many other antidepressants (SSRIs and SNRIs) that are considered highly compatible with breastfeeding and are less likely to impact supply. You need to speak with a physician who specializes in perinatal mental health (or a Reproductive Psychiatrist) about switching to a different class of medication entirely.\n    *   **Commonly Recommended for Breastfeeding:** Sertraline (Zoloft) and Paroxetine (Paxil) are often preferred because very little transfers into the milk.\n*   **Xanax (Alprazolam):** It is crucial to discuss the anxiety component. Xanax is generally discouraged while breastfeeding due to its long half-life and potential for sedation in the baby. Your doctor can explore safer, short-term anxiety medications or non-benzo options.\n\n**B. Re-evaluating Therapy:**\n\nYou mentioned therapy isn't helping and might be making you feel worse. This is a very important point.\n\n*   **Is it the Fit or the Type?** Sometimes, the therapist or the style of therapy isn't the right fit. It might be worth exploring a therapist who specializes specifically in Postpartum Mood and Anxiety Disorders (PMADs) or trying a different modality, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Therapy (IPT), if you are currently doing talk therapy.\n*   **Therapy Alone vs. Meds:** When symptoms are this severe, therapy alone is often not enough. Medication is necessary to lift the depression enough so that you can actually engage with and benefit from therapy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Breastfeeding Dilemma: Supply vs. Mental Health\n\nThis is the core conflict you are facing. It is vital to consider the long-term impact of your mental state on your baby.\n\n### **What is truly \"Best for Him\"?**\n\n*   **Mental Health is Foundational:** A baby needs a mother who is stable, present, and emotionally regulated far more than they need breast milk. If your depression is preventing you from connecting, enjoying, and caring for your baby, addressing the depression *is* the best thing you can do for him.\n    *   *The risk of severe, untreated PPD (which can affect bonding, developmental outcomes, and safety) often outweighs the benefits of breast milk when medication is necessary.*\n\n### **Options to Discuss with Your Doctor/Lactation Consultant:**\n\n**A. The \"Wait and See\" Strategy:**\n\n*   If you switch to a breastfeeding-compatible antidepressant (like Zoloft), you might find that your supply stabilizes. Wellbutrin's effect on supply is specific to that drug, not all antidepressants.\n\n**B. Combination Feeding:**\n\n*   Could you continue to pump/nurse when you can, but supplement with formula? This could reduce the pressure on your supply, allow you to take the medication you need, and ensure your baby is fed, while still giving him some breast milk.\n\n**C. Accepting a Transition to Formula:**\n\n*   If you find that the only medication that truly provides you with stability and relief *does* tank your supply, or if the mental health crisis is too severe to wait for medication adjustments, transitioning to formula might be the most loving and necessary choice for your family's overall health. This decision is heartbreaking, but it prioritizes your ability to be a functional, loving parent.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps You Can Take Now\n\n1.  **Contact Your Prescribing Doctor IMMEDIATELY:** Tell them exactly what you told me: you are struggling with severe despair, anger, and numbness, and you feel you need to be back on medication but the last attempt lowered your supply. Ask them specifically about:\n    *   Switching from Wellbutrin to a breastfeeding-compatible SSRI (like Sertraline).\n    *   The safety of your anxiety medication regimen.\n2.  **Consult a Perinatal Specialist:** If your current doctor is not a reproductive psychiatrist, ask for a referral to one. These specialists are experts in balancing psychiatric needs with pregnancy and breastfeeding.\n3.  **Reach Out for Emergency Support:** If the feelings of despair or hopelessness become overwhelming, please use these resources:\n    *   **National Crisis and Suicide Lifeline:** Call or Text **988**\n    *   **Postpartum Support International (PSI) Hotline:** Call or Text **1-800-944-4773** (They have specialists who understand the breastfeeding/medication conflict.)\n\nYou are not failing. You are an incredible mother fighting a serious illness while trying to do the absolute best for your baby. Please prioritize your recovery so you can be the healthy, present mother your child deserves. We can continue to talk through this as much as you need."
