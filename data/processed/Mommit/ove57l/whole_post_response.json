I just need to post for support. \n\nI brought home newborn baby 2 nights ago and it has been so hard on his 22 month old sister. She has been with grandma while I was at the hospital and was having a great time; but now that I'm back she desperately wants mama to herself. She constantly wants to be picked up and sit on my lap and when she doesn't get her way she breaks into long, intense tantrums. She cries every time she sees me. My husband and mother in law are insistent that she cry it out and I don't give in and give her the love she needs, but it is breaking me. I feel like it is too much change too fast, and that we need to be gentler with her and the transition. We can work on teaching lessons once her mom love cup is filled up and she knows that I am still here and love her unconditionally. \n\nI should be napping but instead I am in bed crying, feeling like like I've gained a baby boy but lost my little girl in the process. \n\nFor context: I had been on mat leave with our toddler for 18 months throughout the pandemic, with very little help or socialization nearby. Of course we are extremely attached. \n\nWhat do you think I should do? If I stay strong through the tantrums will it get better? Open to any and all advice on how to get through this. \n\nThis mom thanks you for the support.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences and reassure me that it will get better. Husband has stepped up immensely and is spending all day every day with toddler doing fun activities. In between I am spending as much special time as I can with her and the crying is less and less every day. She is learning to be a big girl, with mom and dad helping her every step of the way. My hormones have leveled out and I'm no longer the sobbing fit I was when my milk came in, thank God. Next week my mom is coming to help and then its going to be just myself and the two babies figuring it out together. As hard as its going to be, I am looking forward to being just the 3 of us so the toddler knows that she is not being taken away from mommy and that she is a vital part of the team, taking care of baby. Until then I'm trying to rest up as much as possible because I know it's going to be the biggest challenge of my life, keeping both alive and happy! Wish me luck! \n\nThank you again for all the support. Feeling the love."

      "content": "Oh, Mama. Please, take a deep breath. You are in the absolute hardest phase of this transition, and it is completely understandable that you are crying in bed right now. What you are feeling is not just valid, it is *normal*.\n\nYou have not lost your little girl. You have a 22-month-old who is experiencing the biggest, scariest, most confusing shift of her entire life, and she is showing you exactly how much she needs you through her behavior.\n\nThe fact that you were her primary source of support and attachment for 18 months through a pandemic means your bond is incredibly strong. When that anchor suddenly seems unavailable, her world feels like it\u2019s collapsing.\n\nPlease, know this: **It absolutely will get better.** But you are right\u2014the way you get through this initial shock matters greatly.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Trust Your Gut: The Love Cup Theory\n\nYour instinct that you need to be gentler and fill her \"love cup\" first is **100% correct**.\n\nA 22-month-old\u2019s tantrum is not a manipulation tactic; it is communication. She is communicating fear, confusion, and grief over the sudden change in her access to you.\n\n### Why \"Crying It Out\" Right Now is Counterproductive\n\nWhen a child is in a state of distress over a major life change (like a new sibling), forcing them to \"cry it out\" teaches them that when they are most scared and need comfort, their primary caregiver is unavailable.\n\n*   **This is not the time for boundary lessons.** This is the time for connection and reassurance.\n*   **The goal right now is security.** Once she feels secure that Mom is still hers and that the baby is not a threat to her position, her behavior will naturally regulate.\n\nYou are the expert on your daughter. If giving her the hug she needs stops the intense tantrum and resets her emotional state, that is a victory, not a failure.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Practical Strategies for Filling Her Cup\n\nYou are operating on zero sleep and high hormones, so the strategies need to be simple and manageable.\n\n### A. The 5-Minute Connect\n\nThis is the most crucial tool. Ask your husband or MIL to hold the baby for 5-10 minutes (or put the baby safely in a bassinet if they aren\u2019t available). During this time, the toddler gets 100% of your attention.\n\n*   **Get down on the floor.**\n*   **No phones, no distractions, no talk about the baby.**\n*   Read a book, build a tower, sing a song.\n*   Tell her: \"This is *our* special time. Just you and Mama.\"\n\nThis short burst of intense, focused connection often gives her enough security to manage the next hour or two.\n\n### B. Physical Closeness (Even when Busy)\n\nWhen she asks to be picked up while you are nursing or holding the baby, try the following:\n\n*   **The Side-Sit:** If you are sitting to feed the baby, pat the spot next to you and ask her to sit right beside you, touching your hip or leg. You can look at books together while you nurse.\n*   **The Lean:** If you are standing, lean against the wall and ask her to lean in and hug your legs or waist.\n*   **The Narration of Love:** Constantly tell her you love her, even if she is crying. \"I know you are sad. I hear how much you miss being held. Mommy loves you so much, and you are my special girl.\"\n\n### C. Make the Baby *Her* Project\n\nToddlers thrive on feeling important. Instead of treating the baby as competition, make the toddler the \"Chief Baby Helper.\"\n\n*   She can fetch a diaper (even if it\u2019s the wrong size).\n*   She can sing a special song to the baby.\n*   She can put the burp cloth on your shoulder.\n*   **Crucially, praise the *effort* and the *role*, not just the outcome.** \"Wow! Thank you so much for bringing that diaper. You are the best big sister helper in the world!\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Utilizing Your Support System\n\nYour husband and MIL are trying to help, but they are focused on discipline when you need connection. Reroute their energy:\n\n**Your Husband/MIL\u2019s Primary Job Right Now is the Toddler.**\n\nThey should be taking the toddler out of the house for special activities (zoo, park, library) so she gets special, undivided attention that is *not* associated with the baby. This gives you time to rest and bond with the newborn, and it gives the toddler the feeling of being cherished, even if it\u2019s not by you 24/7.\n\nWhen they are home, your husband should be the one putting the toddler to bed, reading stories, and handling her meltdowns so you can conserve your energy.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Your Edit: You Are Already Doing the Right Things!\n\nMama, look at the progress you've made in just two days!\n\n> *Husband has stepped up immensely and is spending all day every day with toddler doing fun activities.*\n\n**This is huge.** This is exactly what she needs. This ensures her need for connection and fun is being met while you recover and manage the newborn.\n\n> *In between I am spending as much special time as I can with her and the crying is less and less every day.*\n\n**This is proof that your gentle, connection-based approach works.** You are successfully refilling her cup, and her nervous system is calming down.\n\n> *I am looking forward to being just the 3 of us so the toddler knows that she is not being taken away from mommy and that she is a vital part of the team...*\n\nThis mindset is beautiful and strong. When your mom leaves, you will enter a new phase of figuring out your routine together, and that focused time will be incredibly bonding. You are setting the foundation for them to be a team, not rivals.\n\nYou are not losing your little girl; you are teaching her that your love is big enough for two. This transition is brutal, but you are navigating it with grace and incredible maternal instinct. **Keep trusting yourself.**\n\nPlease, try to put your phone down and get that nap. You deserve rest, and you are doing an amazing job. Good luck! You\u2019ve got this."
