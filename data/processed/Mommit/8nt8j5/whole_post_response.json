      "content": "Afraid of kid #3\n\nI have 2 children already, age 2 and 4. I didn't want to have another baby but nothing ever turns out as planned. The father wants to keep baby #3, I do not. When i first found out i was pregnant I was pretty set on not keeping it. My relationship with the father of my children is an unhealthy one and I was planning on leaving him. I have finally gotten to a stronger mental state where I feel confident enough to raise 2 kids on my own...but 3... \n My appointment for the abortion is in a week but I feel guilty. I have had an abortion before when I was 20. But now that I have two beautiful babies and know the potential of this little one in me, I'm torn and scared.\nAnd before anyone says it, I am very careful. I am on the pill and do use condoms... so talk about shitty luck...\nI do have the help of family, but I live in a 1 bedroom apartment and own a small Prius... all the added expenses of a 3rd baby. I just don't know...\n\nI came here to see I'd there were other single moms of 3 who have managed... how they managed... maybe I could manage....\n\nEdit:\n\nWow I didn't expect so many positive responses! I honestly needed a place to vent and reading everyone's comments has helped me feel a little less burden. Thank you all.\n\nAs for the relationship between me and the father of my children. He is a recovering addict and just 3 months ago started drinking again just 2 months shy of his year of sobriety. His reasoning: \"Drugs were my problem, not alcohol.\" I finally opened my mouth a few days ago about how he messed up and if he didn't stop I would leave him. He threw away all the bottles he had bought. However, finding out I was pregnant is a kind of wake up call for me. I don't want to be with man waiting for him to convince himself that one drink, or one anything, won't hurt.  I"

      "content": "This sounds like an incredibly difficult and complex situation, and I want to acknowledge how much strength it takes to face all of these huge decisions at once\u2014about your pregnancy, your relationship, and your future as a mother. It is completely understandable that you are feeling torn, scared, and overwhelmed right now.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you are approaching this with deep care and responsibility, thinking not just about yourself, but about the well-being of your two children and the potential third.\n\nYou mentioned you came here hoping to hear from single moms who have managed raising three children, how they did it, and if it might be possible for you too. That is a very specific and helpful question.\n\nWhile I can't provide personal stories, I can help you explore the practical and emotional components of the choice you are facing, focusing on the factors you've raised:\n\n### 1. The Fear of Raising Three Children Alone\n\nYou have already reached a strong mental state where you feel confident raising two children alone, which is a massive achievement. The jump from two to three is often described as the most significant, especially regarding logistics.\n\n**Things that often help single parents manage three children:**\n\n*   **Logistics and Space:** You mentioned living in a one-bedroom apartment and owning a small Prius. This is a very real challenge.\n    *   *Housing:* If you chose to keep the baby, you would likely need to immediately start exploring options for subsidized housing (like Section 8, though waiting lists can be long) or looking into rental assistance programs to find a two-bedroom space.\n    *   *Transportation:* A Prius is small, but you can fit three car seats (with careful selection, often narrow ones like Diono or specific convertible seats) in the back, though it will be tight.\n*   **Support System:** You mentioned the help of family, which is invaluable.\n    *   *Clarity:* If you move forward with baby #3, it might be helpful to have a very honest conversation with your family about the level of support they could realistically provide (e.g., occasional childcare, emergency help, emotional support).\n*   **Financials:** The added expense is real.\n    *   If you keep the baby, you would need to immediately file for child support, even if you are leaving the father, as that money is legally for the children.\n    *   You would also want to explore programs like WIC, SNAP, and state-specific childcare subsidies.\n\n### 2. Navigating the Guilt and the Appointment\n\nIt is completely normal to feel guilty and torn, especially because you already know the joy and potential of a child. This feeling doesn't mean you are making the wrong decision either way; it means you are making a choice between two very difficult paths.\n\n*   **On Guilt:** Guilt often arises when we feel we are letting someone down. In this situation, you are weighing the potential life of this third child against the quality of life you can provide for yourself and your existing two children. There is no moral failing in prioritizing stability and health for your established family unit.\n*   **On the Appointment:** Since your appointment is in a week, you have a crucial window to seek non-judgmental counseling. Many clinics offer options counseling before the procedure to help you talk through the ambivalence and confirm your decision.\n\n### 3. Addressing the Relationship with the Father\n\nYour edit provided crucial context about the father's addiction and your decision to leave him. This is perhaps the most important factor in your overall stability.\n\nYou are taking steps to secure your future by leaving an unhealthy relationship. Introducing a third child into this dynamic would significantly complicate your ability to leave, both emotionally and financially, especially given his recent relapse.\n\n**It is important to separate these two decisions:**\n\n1.  **The decision to leave the father:** You sound confident and strong about this. This is a huge step toward a healthier life for you and your two children.\n2.  **The decision about the pregnancy:** This choice should be made based on what provides the most stable and healthy future *for you and your existing family unit*, knowing that you will be raising the child(ren) primarily on your own.\n\n***\n\n**Before you have to make a final decision, could you tell me more about what specific kind of support or information would be most helpful right now?**\n\nFor example, would you like to explore:\n\n*   The financial resources available to single mothers of multiple children?\n*   Ways to find non-judgmental counseling to talk through the ambivalence before your appointment?\n*   Strategies for planning your exit from the relationship while navigating this pregnancy decision?"
