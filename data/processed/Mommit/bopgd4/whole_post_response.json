      "content": "Need advice from other stay at home moms\n\nI'm 19 and a momma to a lovely 7 (almost 8) month old infant. I'm a stay at home mom and my fiance works. On his days off I would like a little break from caring for our child but its always a fight. I don't even want that much. I just want an hour or two alone. He says he deserves more free time because he pays the bills, but I'm going crazy here. I don't have my license so the only time baby and I get out is if we go for a walk or weekly grocery shopping. I'm so tired of fighting with my fiancee about who takes care of the baby. We tried to establish a 50/50 system where we each take turns doing diapers or feedings but then he gets annoyed by doing \"so much\" (mind you, he isn't the stay at home parent \ud83d\ude24) and then he says things like \"I don't pay for fair, I pay for the apartment.\" \nI should add I have a few mental illnesses I'm unmedicated for. Anxiety, depression, PTSD (from my abusive ex) and bipolar. I am trying to get into therapy but having a little trouble with my insurance on that front.\nFiance expects me to take care of our baby, clean the house, cook. I'm only eating once a day as is, no family to help. My inlaws HATE me. I just feel so trapped and I just need some advice! Anyone else here a stay at home mom? What did you do to not go crazy?"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to start by saying that what you are feeling is completely valid. Being a stay-at-home parent is a 24/7 job, and doing it while dealing with the challenges you\u2019re facing\u2014especially with your fianc\u00e9's lack of support and the serious mental health struggles you mentioned\u2014is an immense burden.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling trapped and going crazy. You are juggling the responsibilities of a full-time caregiver, housekeeper, and cook, all while managing significant mental health conditions without medication or external support. That is simply too much for anyone.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t offer medical or legal advice, I can offer some practical advice and perspective from the viewpoint of someone who understands the demands of early motherhood and the necessity of support.\n\nHere is a breakdown of advice focusing on immediate relief, managing the relationship dynamic, and getting the support you need.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Prioritize Your Mental Health and Basic Needs\n\nYour current situation\u2014only eating once a day and struggling to get therapy\u2014is a crisis point. Before you can tackle the cleaning or the relationship fights, you need to stabilize yourself.\n\n### **Immediate Survival Mode**\n\n*   **Eat:** You cannot pour from an empty cup, especially when dealing with mental health issues. Your brain and body need fuel. **Make eating twice a day (at minimum) non-negotiable.** This doesn't have to be a cooked meal. Think simple: peanut butter toast, a protein shake, instant oatmeal, or a handful of nuts and an apple.\n*   **Lower Expectations for the House:** Right now, your job is keeping yourself and your baby healthy. The rest is secondary.\n    *   **Focus on 'Safe and Sanitary' only.** If the dishes are clean enough to eat off and the floor is clear of tripping hazards, that is enough.\n    *   **Forget deep cleaning.** If you have to choose between scrubbing the bathroom and eating a sandwich, eat the sandwich.\n*   **Pursue Therapy Relentlessly:** You mentioned trouble with insurance.\n    *   **Contact your insurance provider directly** and ask specifically for a list of in-network mental health providers who offer telehealth (which eliminates the travel issue).\n    *   Look into **sliding scale clinics or community mental health centers** in your area. They often charge based on income.\n    *   If you are in the US, look for programs like **WIC (Women, Infants, and Children)**\u2014they can sometimes connect you with local resources and support groups.\n\n## 2. Addressing the Relationship Dynamic\n\nThe core issue here is that your fianc\u00e9 views childcare and household management as **your job** because he is the primary financial provider. His statement, \"I don't pay for fair, I pay for the apartment,\" is dismissive of the immense value of your labor.\n\n### **The \"Break\" Issue**\n\nYou absolutely deserve a break. Childcare is exhausting.\n\n*   **Reframe the Conversation (If possible):** Stop asking for \"free time\" and start asking for **\"shift coverage.\"** Frame it not as a favor, but as a necessary transfer of responsibility.\n*   **Schedule It Like a Job:** Since he views things in terms of work, treat your break like a scheduled shift change.\n    *   \"On Saturday, my childcare shift ends at 10:00 AM. Your shift begins at 10:00 AM and ends at 12:00 PM. I will be taking a walk/shower/nap during that time.\"\n    *   If he fights it, simply hand him the baby (safely, of course) and walk out the door for your scheduled time. Do not engage in a debate. **This requires strength, but remember, you are not asking for permission.**\n\n### **The 50/50 System Failure**\n\nTrying to split every diaper or feeding often fails because it\u2019s hard to track. Since you are the SAHM, you will naturally do the majority, but he needs to own defined tasks.\n\n*   **Assign Ownership, Not Just Turns:** Instead of 50/50, assign him specific, repeatable duties for his days off:\n    *   **\"You are solely responsible for the baby from 8 AM to 12 PM on Saturdays.\"**\n    *   **\"You are responsible for all dinner dishes every evening.\"**\n    *   **\"You are responsible for all trash and recycling.\"**\n    *   **\"You are responsible for one full hour of playtime/tummy time with the baby every evening after work.\"**\n\n### **The Financial Argument**\n\nHis argument that his work is more valuable because it pays the bills is a common tactic used to dismiss the value of domestic labor.\n\n*   **The Cost of a Nanny/Cleaner:** If you were not doing this job, he would have to pay someone else. Look up the average cost of a nanny and a cleaning service in your area. You are saving him thousands of dollars every month. **You are contributing financially by eliminating major expenses.**\n*   **If you feel safe doing so, try to communicate this:** \"I am saving us $4,000 a month in childcare and cleaning expenses. My contribution is labor, not salary. If I quit my job, we would have to pay someone else to do it.\"\n\n## 3. Finding Support and Not Going Crazy\n\nYou are isolated, which is a huge factor in feeling \"crazy.\" Isolation breeds anxiety and depression. Since you don't have a license, your options are limited, but not non-existent.\n\n### **Connect with Other Moms**\n\n*   **Local Library Story Time:** Most libraries offer free story time or baby groups. This is a great, low-stress way to get out of the house and meet other parents. Walk there if it's feasible.\n*   **Online SAHM Communities:** Since you are already online asking for advice, look for local Facebook groups for moms in your specific city or neighborhood. Sometimes groups organize park meetups or even carpools for events.\n*   **Walks are Your Lifeline:** Even if it feels mundane, schedule a walk every single day, even if it's just 20 minutes. Fresh air helps immensely with anxiety and energy levels. Use that time to listen to a podcast, an audiobook, or music\u2014something that is **just for you.**\n\n### **Managing the In-Laws and Lack of Family**\n\nThis is hard, but since they hate you, **disengage completely.** Stop trying to interact or seek help from them. Their negativity is only adding to your stress. Focus on building your own small circle of support (even if it's just online friends right now).\n\n---\n\n### **A Note on the Mental Health Diagnosis**\n\nYou mentioned severe conditions (Bipolar, PTSD, Anxiety, Depression). Please take this seriously. Your fianc\u00e9's lack of support is not just causing stress; it is potentially exacerbating serious, untreated medical conditions.\n\nIf you hit a point where you feel unsafe or unable to cope, please reach out immediately for emergency help:\n\n*   **Call or Text 988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)\n*   **Text HOME to 741741** (Crisis Text Line)\n\nYou are doing an incredible job under immense pressure. Being a mom to a 7-month-old is hard, and you are handling so much more than just that. Be kind to yourself, lower the bar for housework, and fight for the basic support you need and deserve."
