I\u2019m a stay at home mom for our 2 toddlers. We recently opened up a restaurant and last night was the first live music night. Guess where I was? Yep, home with the kids. \n\nI\u2019d done my best to try and find a sitter but I couldn\u2019t. And DH didn\u2019t say anything about a sitter too, just that it sucks I can\u2019t be there. I could have\u2026 if he tried to find a sitter, too. Or at the very least send videos of the performance, instead I saw pics and short clips on FB and Insta. \n\nTo say I\u2019m crushed in an understatement. I don\u2019t get to go out a lot already and I stressed how much it\u2019d mean to me to be there for our first ever live music event to DH. I think I\u2019m understandably upset. \n\nSo when DH asked me why I\u2019m so bummed out this morning I told him I feel a little left out and sad I couldn\u2019t be there last night. Lately I\u2019ve been struggling with not working anymore and even just not being there to help with service fills me with so much guilt. \n\nWell, he took it personally. Like, hard. He said I have no reason to complain as we both tried and it didn\u2019t work out. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like an entitled bitch for not getting your way.\u201d I could see it in his eyes as soon as he said it he didn\u2019t mean it, but the damage is done. \n\nI\u2019m an entitled bitch for feeling left out. Okay. He apologized for saying it, he didn\u2019t mean a word of it he just got caught up in the moment, but I didn\u2019t believe him. He\u2019s disrespected me before in arguments. This is the last straw. I\u2019m not leaving him or anything but damn, that hurt. A lot. It\u2019s going to take some time for me to even look at him without wanting to cry. I know it\u2019s not true but it hurts knowing he thinks that about me. \n\nI gave up so much to be a stay at home mom. I worked 2 good jobs, aspired to attend college or uni, I used to be a decent author\u2026 that all stopped when I got pregnant with our oldest. And ever since having our kids my health has gotten so bad. I usually don\u2019t complain, it\u2019s just that lately it\u2019s been hitting me hard that outside of having my kids I have no real achievements to celebrate. Woo, I made it out of poor family situation as a kid, yay! But I wanted to much more for myself. Grief is a fickle thing, I\u2019m only human and I can\u2019t help it. But I\u2019m entitled for feeling bad? For leaving left behind at home? \n\nIdk. My heart hurts and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to face him later. I can\u2019t stop crying, even after taking my prescribed anxiety meds. How I do I move on from this? Can we? "

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult situation, and I am so sorry you are going through this pain. Please take a deep breath. What you are feeling\u2014crushed, heartbroken, isolated, and disrespected\u2014is completely understandable.\n\nBefore we discuss moving forward, I want to say this clearly: **You are not an entitled bitch.** Your feelings are valid, and they are rooted in legitimate grief, exhaustion, and the profound sacrifices you have made for your family.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what happened and how you can manage the pain right now.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating Your Pain and Grief\n\nThe reason this insult hurt so deeply is because it directly attacked the core of your sacrifice and your current struggle for identity.\n\n### Your Feelings Are Justified\n*   **The Live Music Night:** You were looking forward to this milestone, and your absence was a failure of partnership. It wasn't just *you* who failed to find a sitter; it was a joint responsibility that he ignored, prioritizing his attendance over ensuring you both could celebrate the business milestone. Feeling left out is a natural consequence of this imbalance.\n*   **The Undervalued Role:** Being a SAHM to two toddlers while a new business is launching is monumental labor. It is a 24/7 job that makes his dreams possible. To have your contributions dismissed and your legitimate sadness labeled as \"entitlement\" is a cruel blow.\n*   **Grieving Lost Aspirations:** It is completely normal to grieve the career, educational, and creative paths you put on hold. This grief doesn't make you ungrateful; it makes you human. It\u2019s part of the complexity of motherhood, and it deserves acknowledgment, not dismissal.\n\n### The Insult is a Boundary Violation\nWhen he called you an \"entitled b****,\" he wasn't just having a momentary slip; he was crossing a serious line. Regardless of his apology, those words reveal a dangerous tendency to use cruel language to shut down your valid concerns. The fact that he has \"disrespected you before in arguments\" confirms that this is a pattern of behavior, not an isolated mistake. This is why it feels like the last straw\u2014because it is proof that the pattern is still active.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Immediate Steps: How to Face Him Today\n\nYour priority right now is self-care, emotional safety, and setting a firm boundary. You cannot have a productive conversation while you are still reeling from the shock and pain.\n\n### A. Create Space\nDo not try to force a reconciliation or a deep discussion today. You need time to stabilize your emotions.\n\n1.  **Physical Space:** If possible, take the kids out, or retreat to a separate room when he is home. Tell him clearly (if you need to communicate at all): *\"I am still deeply hurt by your words, and I need space to process this. I am not ready to talk about this yet.\"*\n2.  **Emotional Space:** Focus on coping mechanisms that soothe your anxiety\u2014whether that is journaling, a warm bath, listening to music, or talking to a trusted friend. Do not feel obligated to cater to his need for immediate forgiveness.\n\n### B. Write It Down\nWhen you are ready to address him, you may find that the pain makes it hard to speak clearly. Writing down your feelings can be incredibly helpful.\n\n*   **Document the Impact:** Write down exactly how you felt when he said those words, and why this is the \"last straw.\"\n*   **Clarify the Systemic Issue:** Explain that this isn\u2019t just about missing the concert; it\u2019s about feeling invisible, unappreciated, and disrespected in the partnership.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Long-Term Strategy: Can You Move On?\n\nYou asked, \"How do I move on from this? Can we?\"\n\nThe answer is: **You can only move on if he truly recognizes the severity of his actions and commits to changing the fundamental dynamics of your relationship.**\n\nMoving past this requires two things: addressing the communication problem (the insults) and addressing the systemic problem (the unequal burden of labor and emotional load).\n\n### Step 1: Set a Zero-Tolerance Boundary\nWhen you are ready to talk (which might not be for a few days), you must make it clear that the use of disrespectful, name-calling language is a boundary that, if crossed again, will lead to serious consequences (e.g., separating households, ending the marriage).\n\n**What to Communicate:**\n\n> *\"Your apology for calling me an 'entitled b****' isn't enough this time. Because this is a pattern of disrespect, I need to know that you understand the damage you caused. I am not demanding forgiveness, but I am demanding respect. From this moment forward, I have a zero-tolerance policy for name-calling and verbal abuse in our arguments. If you cross that line again, it will fundamentally change our relationship.\"*\n\n### Step 2: Address the Unseen Labor\nThe argument about entitlement stems from him fundamentally misunderstanding the value of your work as a SAHM. You need a formal conversation about the division of labor.\n\n*   **The Partnership Model:** Explain that the restaurant is a joint venture, even if you are not physically serving tables. Your job is supporting the children and the home so he can work. That job deserves respect, appreciation, and time off.\n*   **The Sitter Issue:** Use the concert incident as a clear example of where the partnership failed. If an event is important to both of you, both of you must actively participate in finding childcare.\n*   **Time for Yourself:** You need time to pursue your own interests again, whether that\u2019s writing, studying, or just being alone. This needs to be scheduled into the week, and he needs to take full responsibility for the kids during that time.\n\n### Step 3: Seek Professional Help\nGiven the pattern of disrespect and the deep emotional pain you are experiencing, I strongly recommend seeking professional support.\n\n*   **Individual Therapy:** This is crucial for you to process your anxiety, your grief over your lost identity, and the trauma of being verbally attacked. A therapist can help you rebuild your sense of self-worth and give you tools to set and enforce boundaries.\n*   **Couples Counseling:** If the relationship is going to survive, you need a safe, neutral space to discuss these deep issues (the sacrifices, the lack of appreciation, and the verbal disrespect). A counselor can teach you both healthy conflict resolution methods so that arguments don't devolve into verbal attacks.\n\nHealing from this kind of hurt takes time. Be gentle with yourself. Focus on getting through the next few hours, and know that your pain is valid and deserves compassion."
