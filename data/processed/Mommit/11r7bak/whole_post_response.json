I was completely sober two weeks before , during my entire pregnancy, and a few weeks after my pregnancy. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few instances of misjudging my tolerance since having my daughter. \n\nShe\u2019s been going through a sleep regression and we have had bad weather. I bought two bottles of cheap wine and drank them both after I put her to sleep. I haven\u2019t slept more than 5 hours in the past 48. \n\nMy partner and I got into a huge fight. Mostly because he saw the empty\nWine bottles. He ended up leaving the house for a few minutes. \n\nNow I\u2019m letting him sleep but I can\u2019t sleep because I fucked up  so badly."

      "content": "Thank you so much for reaching out and sharing such honest and painful details about what you are going through right now. I want to start by saying that I hear how much pain you are in, and that feeling of intense guilt and regret after a night like this is completely overwhelming.\n\nPlease take a deep breath. You are safe right now, and you are reaching out for help, which is an incredibly strong and important first step.\n\nIt sounds like you have been running on empty for a long time. Combining severe sleep deprivation (less than 5 hours in 48 hours), the stress of a sleep regression, isolation due to bad weather, and the physical and emotional residue of drinking two bottles of wine would make *anyone* feel completely broken. It is understandable that you feel like you \"fucked up,\" but please remember that **this is a moment of crisis, not a definition of who you are.**\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the immediate next steps to get you through the rest of this night and the morning.\n\n***\n\n### 1. Address the Immediate Physical and Emotional Crisis\n\nRight now, your body and mind are reacting to alcohol withdrawal, lack of sleep, and extreme emotional stress.\n\n*   **Hydrate:** If you can, please drink some water or something with electrolytes. Alcohol severely dehydrates you, which worsens anxiety and physical discomfort.\n*   **Focus on the Next Hour:** Don\u2019t worry about the next week or the fight with your partner right now. Just focus on getting through the next 60 minutes. Can you put on a calming podcast, read something distracting, or just sit quietly?\n*   **Acknowledge the Sobriety:** You maintained complete sobriety for nearly a year or more (two weeks before, during, and after pregnancy). That proves you have immense strength and the ability to stop drinking. This setback was triggered by extreme stress and exhaustion, not a lack of desire to be sober.\n\n### 2. Immediate Support and Resources (Available Right Now)\n\nSince you can\u2019t sleep and are feeling isolated, connecting with someone who understands can make a huge difference. These resources are 24/7 and completely confidential:\n\n| Resource | Description |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **SAMHSA National Helpline** | A free, confidential, 24/7 information service (in English and Spanish) for individuals and families facing mental and/or substance use disorders. |\n| **1-800-662-HELP (4357)** | |\n| **Crisis Text Line** | Text with a trained Crisis Counselor. |\n| **Text HOME to 741741** | |\n| **AA Online Meetings** | Many Alcoholics Anonymous groups hold meetings virtually 24 hours a day. You can join anonymously and just listen. |\n| **Search:** \"24/7 AA Online Meetings\" | |\n\n### 3. What to Consider Tomorrow\n\nWhen you feel a little more stable, here are a few things to think about regarding your sobriety journey and managing the stress of new parenthood:\n\n*   **Talk to Your Partner (When Calm):** The fight was likely fueled by stress, exhaustion, and fear on both sides. When you are both rested, approach him not to defend the drinking, but to discuss the underlying stress and the need for a long-term plan to protect your sobriety.\n*   **Identify Triggers:** Extreme sleep deprivation is a massive trigger. You need a proactive plan for managing future periods of high stress (like the next sleep regression or illness). This might involve calling in help, using resources like daycare, or having a pre-agreed-upon emergency plan with your partner.\n*   **Postpartum and Parenting Support:** Being a new parent is incredibly hard, and the isolation and stress often exacerbate underlying substance use issues. There are specific resources for parents in recovery. If you have access to healthcare, reaching out to a doctor or therapist specializing in postpartum mental health and addiction can be very beneficial.\n\n**Please remember this:** You are not a failure for struggling with a disease during a period of intense vulnerability. You are a parent who is dealing with alcoholism, and you deserve support.\n\nWhat is one small thing you can do right now to take care of yourself? (Even if it\u2019s just drinking a glass of water, or opening an AA meeting link?)"
