      "content": "Intense guilt over the love and care I give my child.\n\nHi moms. I (39) am a full-time working mom of a 2.5 yo. Around 6-7 months post partum, I was suddenly hit with the thought from out of nowhere, while kissing and cuddling with my baby, that there may be another baby/babies like him who may be neglected, abused and unloved right that moment. It was a gut-punching guilt and for another couple of weeks, I had it in my mind 24x7. I tried donating to local charities caring for kids and Non-profits back in my home country but it obviously didn\u2019t help. This kept happening on and off until he started daycare at 13 months, at which point, I became too busy with work and I almost stopped having time for anything other than routine life. \n\nBut 2 nights back, while cuddling and talking to my son while putting him to bed, he had his usual belly laugh and all of a sudden the old guilt came back. Since then I haven\u2019t been able to sleep normally. During the day, while working, I have to listen to some music to keep my thoughts distracted. Last 2 nights and tonight, I am watching some crap on YouTube until I tire out to sleep. \n\nHave any of you had similar experiences? Is this normal?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all so much for your advice and sharing your experiences. It felt better to know that a lot of us go through this. I met with my Doctor last week. Ended up breaking down and crying in her office. Got referred to a therapist. Will be meeting her next week."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly tough, and I want to start by saying that I hear you and I appreciate you sharing such a deeply personal and difficult experience. It takes a lot of courage to talk about feelings like this, especially when they disrupt your sleep and daily life.\n\nIt's completely understandable why you are looking for support and clarity on this feeling.\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the positive steps you have already taken:\n\n1. **You recognized the severity of the issue:** You noticed when the guilt first appeared, when it lessened, and when it returned, showing great self-awareness.\n2. **You sought help:** You reached out to your doctor, which is a crucial step.\n3. **You are following through:** Getting a referral and scheduling an appointment with a therapist next week is a fantastic move toward getting the professional support you need.\n\n### Addressing Your Questions:\n\nYou asked if this is normal and if others have had similar experiences.\n\nWhile the *intensity* of the guilt you describe\u2014where it hits you like a gut punch and disrupts your sleep\u2014might feel overwhelming and unusual, the underlying feeling of **empathy and concern for other children** is very common among parents.\n\nWhen you become a parent, your capacity for love and vulnerability expands massively. This often comes with an increased awareness of the world's pain, particularly pain related to children. It's a natural function of your protective instincts expanding beyond just your own child.\n\nHowever, when these feelings become intrusive, persistent, and debilitating (making it hard to sleep, work, or enjoy time with your child), it moves beyond typical empathy and suggests something more is going on, which is why seeing a professional is so important.\n\n### What Might Be Happening:\n\nThe feelings you describe\u2014intrusive thoughts that cause intense distress and require distraction\u2014are often symptoms related to anxiety, and sometimes specifically linked to **Postpartum Anxiety (PPA)** or **Postpartum Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (POCD)**.\n\n*   **Intrusive Thoughts:** The thought that hit you (\"there may be another baby/babies like him who may be neglected, abused and unloved right that moment\") is an example of an intrusive thought. These are unwanted, distressing thoughts that pop into your mind against your will.\n*   **Guilt as a Symptom:** In your case, the intrusive thought immediately triggers intense guilt. This is a very common mechanism in POCD, where the parent feels profound responsibility or guilt over things they cannot control.\n*   **The Need for Distraction/Rituals:** Your attempt to donate (trying to \"solve\" the guilt) and your current need to listen to music or watch YouTube crap (to distract from the thoughts) are common coping mechanisms for managing intense anxiety driven by intrusive thoughts.\n\n**It is important to emphasize that this is not a character flaw or a sign that you are doing anything wrong. It is a psychological response that needs treatment.**\n\n### Moving Forward:\n\nYou have already taken the most important step by getting a referral to a therapist. Here are a few things you can do to prepare for that appointment and manage the next few days:\n\n1.  **Write Down Your Experience:** Before your session, try to write down everything you told us, including the timelines (6-7 months postpartum, 13 months, 2 nights ago), the exact thoughts you have, and how they make you feel (the guilt, the gut-punch feeling). This will help you articulate everything clearly to the therapist, even if you break down again.\n2.  **Be Honest About the Intensity:** Make sure you tell the therapist how disruptive this is\u2014that you cannot sleep normally and need constant distraction during the day.\n3.  **Acknowledge Your Progress:** Remind yourself that the fact you *can* enjoy your child (like the moment leading up to his belly laugh) shows that the love and care are real. The guilt is an unwanted reaction, not a true reflection of your capacity to be a good mother.\n\nYou are doing a wonderful job caring for your son, and the care you are showing for yourself by seeking help is equally important. Please lean on the support you are about to receive from the therapist.\n\nDo you have any specific concerns about the upcoming therapy appointment, or anything else you'd like to talk through right now?"
