I\u2019ve never been able to keep dog beds in the house because they pee on them or the dog blankets. But ever since we had our son last year, their behavior is off the charts. They\u2019re on very expensive\u2014 we can barely afford it\u2014 urinary stress diet food, our female has had bladder stones removed and they\u2019re both checked out for them every year. But every day it seems I\u2019m cleaning something with cat pee on it and I\u2019m just so, so, so done.\n\nMy couch, the couch cushions while the couch covers are in the wash, the dog blankets (again) my clean laundry basket, my baby\u2019s play mat, I\u2019m telling you\u2026 everywhere. I can\u2019t catch up.\n\nThey eat well, they have access to plenty of water, they have their own space away from our dogs and the baby, they have multiple litter boxes scooped daily and completely overhauled every month. I\u2019m so over my head and no amount of Zoloft can make this okay for me. I get no help with any of this from my husband either since he works 60 hours so I can stay home and take care of all of\u2026 this. I\u2019ve tried rehoming them but no one wants 5 year old bonded cats. They only want to give advice which I\u2019ve taken. I\u2019ve tried it all. For a year. \n\nAre the dogs and baby too much for my cats? Would they thrive more in a home without so much going on? Is this their way of telling me? I just dont know what to do. I love them, but I swear to god if I have to wash one more thing with cat pee on it I am going to combust.\n\nEdit: Thank you so much for all of the support and understanding. Before I had my baby, my pets were my life. My babies. I foster failed these kittens because I couldn\u2019t handle giving them away, and it\u2019s not any easier now 5 years later. If I had known then what I know now, I would\u2019ve adopted them out as kittens. Hindsight is 20/20. My husband and I now have a very difficult decision to make. "

      "content": "This sounds incredibly overwhelming, exhausting, and stressful. Please know that what you are feeling is completely valid. Dealing with constant cleaning, the expense of special diets and vet care, and the emotional toll of feeling like you can't catch up\u2014especially while caring for a baby and feeling unsupported in this specific area\u2014is a huge burden.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are at your breaking point.\n\nLet\u2019s talk through this. It sounds like you are facing a multifaceted problem: chronic cat urinary issues, stress related to the new baby and household changes, and a significant lack of support in managing the resulting mess.\n\n### Addressing Your Questions and Feelings\n\nYou asked if the dogs and baby are too much for the cats, and if they would thrive more in a calmer home.\n\n**The short answer is: Very likely, yes.**\n\nCats are creatures of habit, and they are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment and household stress.\n\n*   **The Baby:** Even a very calm baby introduces massive changes: new smells, new sounds (crying), new routines, and a massive shift in where your time and attention are focused.\n*   **The Dogs:** If the cats feel they have to constantly compete for territory or feel threatened by the dogs, this raises their stress levels significantly.\n*   **The Existing History:** The fact that they were already peeing on dog beds *before* the baby arrived suggests a long-standing issue with stress, territory, or underlying medical/behavioral anxiety.\n*   **Urinary Issues (FIC/Stress):** The history of bladder stones and the need for a urinary stress diet strongly indicates that their urinary tract health is highly sensitive to anxiety (often called Feline Idiopathic Cystitis or FIC). In cats prone to FIC, *any* stressor can cause internal inflammation and the feeling of needing to urinate immediately, leading to accidents.\n\nWhen cats inappropriately eliminate, it is almost always a signal that something is wrong\u2014medically, environmentally, or emotionally. In your case, it seems to be a combination of all three, exacerbated by the massive change of having a baby. **This is absolutely their way of telling you they are struggling to cope.**\n\n### What to Consider Now\n\nYou mentioned you have tried everything and have been rehoming them for a year. It sounds like you are past the point of wanting more advice on litter box placement or diet changes, and you are looking at the difficult decision you mentioned in your edit.\n\nSince you are at your limit, we need to focus on what is sustainable and best for the well-being of *everyone* involved\u2014you, your baby, and the cats.\n\n#### 1. Prioritizing Your Mental Health and Household Sanitation\n\nThe constant cleaning and stress are impacting your mental health (as you noted with the Zoloft comment). Your priority must be yourself and your baby. Chronic cat urine messes pose sanitation risks (even if cleaned thoroughly) and are a significant daily stressor that you do not deserve to carry alone.\n\n#### 2. Revisiting the Rehoming Challenge\n\nYou are correct that rehoming bonded, adult cats can be very difficult through typical adoption channels. However, given the severity of the situation, it might be time to look at options that provide the best chance for them to find a quieter, less stressful environment where they *can* thrive.\n\n*   **Veterinary Behavioral Referral:** Has your vet referred you to a **Certified Veterinary Behaviorist (DACVB)**? This is different from a regular vet or a trainer. A behaviorist could offer an *intensive* plan (including potential anxiety medication for the cats, which can drastically reduce FIC episodes) and may even have connections to rescue groups or sanctuaries that specialize in cats with behavioral needs, recognizing that a home with a baby and dogs is simply not the right fit for them.\n*   **No-Kill Shelters/Rescues with Fostering Networks:** Sometimes, a specialized rescue group (not a general shelter) that uses a robust foster network can find a placement for bonded pairs, especially if they understand the history and can market them as \"cats who need a quiet, adult-only home.\" You may need to explain the situation honestly: \"These cats are wonderful and bonded, but they are highly sensitive to stress and need a single-pet, quiet environment to manage their urinary issues.\"\n\n#### 3. Creating an Immediate, Drastic Separation (A Temporary Solution)\n\nIf you need a break *right now* to regain sanity while you work on the long-term solution, you need to completely remove the cats from the main living areas where the accidents are occurring.\n\n*   **The \"Sanctuary Room\":** Dedicate one small, easily cleaned room (like a bathroom, laundry room, or spare bedroom with tiled/vinyl floors) as a temporary, luxurious sanctuary for the cats.\n    *   They get their food, water, multiple litter boxes, scratching posts, and cozy beds in this room.\n    *   They are completely separated from the dogs and the baby.\n    *   You and your husband can rotate short visits for cuddles.\n    *   This gives you a chance to stop the cycle of cleaning pee from the couch and laundry basket, and it gives the cats a true decompression zone.\n\nIf the cats are still eliminating outside the box in this *calm, separated* environment, it confirms that their stress is so high they need a dramatic environmental change (i.e., a new home).\n\n### The Heartbreaking Decision\n\nYou are a loving pet owner who has gone above and beyond for these cats, investing immense time, money, and emotional energy into their health and well-being. It takes immense strength to recognize that sometimes, the most loving thing you can do for a pet is admit that you cannot provide the specific environment they need to be healthy and happy.\n\n**If you determine that rehoming is the only way for your cats to thrive and for your family's stress levels to become manageable, you are making a responsible and compassionate choice.**\n\n**What specifically do you need support with right now?** Are you looking for resources to find specialized rehoming options, or do you need help structuring a conversation with your husband about how to move forward and share the immediate burden?"
