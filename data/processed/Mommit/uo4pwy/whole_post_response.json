      "content": "I need help...\n\nHello all,\nI'm writing because I desperately need help/advice/emotional support.\n\nI'm a 27 year-old mum, I work from home 100% and I have 2 children: a 3 year-old son and a 6 month-old daughter.\nMy son goes to school but I pick him up for lunch. My daughter doesn't go to daycare as I'm home (and appreciate saving money). However... Things are getting harder and harder as my husband can't really help when he's home. He starts his shift as a delivery man at 4am and is usually home around 3:30 or 4pm, exhausted. He falls asleep around 6pm (when I finish my shift) and so, after having worked all day on the computer (+ looking after the kids in the meantime), I'm alone for the evening to take care of the kids, do the cooking, the cleaning etc.\n\nI'm... Just... So tired and mentally drained. I feel I don't have 5 minutes for myself.\nMy mental health has never been great and it's getting super challenging right now and I don't know how to feel better... I'm crying basically everyday, because I'm so tired and overwhelmed.\nI don't find pleasure in anything, I don't even know what I'd like to do if I had the time! I've lost interest in everything...\n\nI feel so isolated, I don't know how to improve things, I feel horrible.\n\nSorry if my English isn't great at times - I'm French!\n\nThank you for reading and for any advice you could provide me with!"

      "content": "*Please note: I am a support resource, not a medical professional. Given how exhausted and overwhelmed you are feeling, if you feel you are in crisis, please contact your local emergency services or a mental health professional immediately.*\n\nBonjour. Thank you so much for reaching out and sharing what you are going through. Your English is excellent, and more importantly, your message came through loud and clear: **You are carrying an absolutely unsustainable load, and you are completely drained.**\n\nPlease know that what you are describing\u2014the daily crying, the loss of interest, the intense isolation, and the sheer physical exhaustion\u2014is a very common, yet extremely painful, response to the relentless demands you are facing. You are not failing; you are attempting to do the work of three people simultaneously, and it is impossible.\n\nYou are a full-time employee, a full-time stay-at-home parent (for the baby), a part-time parent (for the preschooler), a cook, a cleaner, and a manager of the household\u2014all without a break. It is completely natural that you feel this way.\n\nLet\u2019s look at this in two parts: Immediate Support (Mental Health) and Practical Adjustments (Rebalancing the Load).\n\n---\n\n## Part I: Immediate Support & Mental Health\n\nThe exhaustion has pushed you past your limits. This is the moment where you need to prioritize *you* above everything else\u2014even the cleanliness of the kitchen.\n\n### 1. Consult a Professional Immediately\n\nYou mentioned that your mental health has never been great, and you are now crying every day. This is a critical signal that you need professional help.\n\n*   **Contact your GP (m\u00e9decin g\u00e9n\u00e9raliste):** Explain exactly what you wrote here. They can assess you for burnout, depression, or postnatal depletion. They can offer advice, resources, or potentially medication to help stabilize your mood while you work on practical changes.\n*   **Do not feel guilty:** Seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. You wouldn't try to fix a broken leg alone, and this is a serious health issue.\n\n### 2. Lower the Bar on Everything\n\nYou are in survival mode. For the next few weeks, your only goal is to keep yourself and your children safe and fed.\n\n*   **Food:** Prioritize easy meals. Buy frozen meals, order delivery once a week, or embrace simple things like pasta with butter, eggs, or sandwiches for dinner. **The standard of cooking right now is irrelevant.**\n*   **Cleaning:** Let it go. Close the door on the rooms you can\u2019t manage. Focus only on essential hygiene (dishes, wiping down the toilet). Mess does not equal moral failure.\n*   **Work:** If possible, talk to your manager about your schedule. Are there any truly flexible hours? Can you log off at 6 pm sharp, even if it means logging on earlier?\n\n---\n\n## Part II: Practical Adjustments & Rebalancing\n\nThe current dynamic where your husband works his shift, and then you immediately start your \"second shift\" alone until you collapse, is the core problem. While his job is physically demanding, your job is equally demanding (mentally and physically).\n\n### 1. Non-Negotiable Time for Yourself\n\nYou need five minutes, but since you are isolated, you have to *take* them, even if it feels selfish.\n\n*   **The 15-Minute Rule:** When your husband walks in the door around 3:30/4:00 pm, he needs to take the children for 15 uninterrupted minutes *immediately*. He can be exhausted on the sofa, but he is the primary caregiver for those 15 minutes. Use that time to shower, sit in silence, or make a cup of tea. This is your essential transition from work/childcare back to being a person.\n\n### 2. Re-evaluating Childcare\n\nYou mentioned appreciating saving money by keeping the baby home. I understand this completely, but I need you to weigh the cost savings against the cost to your health.\n\n*   **Part-Time Cr\u00e8che/Nounou:** Even two or three mornings a week for your 6-month-old daughter could be life-changing. It would give you focused work time (reducing stress/guilt during the day) and allow you to breathe. Your income and mental health are worth investing in.\n\n### 3. Communicating with Your Husband\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation when you are both calm (not at 6 pm when he\u2019s falling asleep). Write down your feelings and the facts:\n\n> \"I am breaking down. I am crying every day, and I cannot continue to manage the entire household and all evening childcare alone. I know you are exhausted from your job, but I need a partner in the evenings, not a third child to care for.\"\n\n**Focus on specific tasks he can manage, even if he is tired:**\n\n*   **The 6:00 pm Hand-Off:** When you finish your shift, he must take over one essential task before he falls asleep. This could be:\n    *   Bathing the 3-year-old.\n    *   Washing the dinner dishes (you cook, he cleans).\n    *   Handling the baby\u2019s 7 pm bottle/diaper change.\n*   **The Weekend:** Even if he needs to catch up on sleep, he must take a dedicated shift on Saturday or Sunday. Can he take both kids out of the house for 2 hours on a Saturday morning so you can genuinely rest, read, or sit in silence?\n\n### 4. Addressing Isolation\n\nIsolation feeds depression and burnout. You need adult connection.\n\n*   **Connect Locally:** Are there any local parent groups (maybe through your son\u2019s school)? Even exchanging a few texts with another parent can help you feel less alone.\n*   **Online Support:** If local connection is impossible, find online groups (French or English-speaking) for WFH parents or mums with similar-aged children. Sharing experiences helps break down the feeling that you are the only one struggling.\n\nYou are doing an amazing job under impossible circumstances. Please be kind to yourself. Focus on getting professional support and finding just two hours of childcare relief a week. You deserve rest, and your health is paramount. *Courage.*"
