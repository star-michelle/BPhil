      "content": "11 month old refusing bottle and it's killing my mental health\n\nThis is mostly a vent because I have no one else I can talk to about this. \n\nMy 11 month old has recently been refusing bottles. No idea why, just started about a week ago. He refuses to drink them at daycare and barely tolerates them at home. This has been causing me a lot of stress, especially because he lost a lot of weight when he was first born and I struggled with nursing initially. The first few weeks of his life were super traumatic for me and I realize I'm still carrying a lot of that.\n\nThis has also resulted in him waking up super hungry at night when he didn't used to, which is hardest on me because I handle nights since it's easier to just nurse him than heat a bottle that he might reject anyways. \n\nMy husband is great and tries to be supportive, but it frustrates me that he just doesn't take this seriously. He thinks I'm stressing for no reason, and even seems annoyed when I talk about it with him because I bring it up constantly. He can't empathize with where I'm coming from and he doesn't deal with the consequences directly, so I feel super helpless and like I need to just suffer silently and alone.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here. I guess reassurance this gets better? That maybe it's a phase my baby will grow out of? "

      "content": "This sounds incredibly tough, and I want to start by saying I hear you. Please know that what you are feeling is completely valid, and it makes perfect sense that you are stressed and overwhelmed right now.\n\nIt takes immense strength to reach out when you're feeling this way, especially when you feel like you're carrying this burden alone.\n\n### Acknowledge the Weight You're Carrying\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the core issues here:\n\n1.  **The Immediate Stressor:** Your 11-month-old is refusing bottles, leading to poor intake during the day and disrupted sleep at night.\n2.  **The Historical Trauma:** The difficulties you experienced right after birth regarding feeding and weight loss are still impacting you. This isn't \"stressing for no reason\"\u2014this is a very real, deeply rooted fear being triggered.\n3.  **The Emotional Isolation:** You feel unsupported and unheard by your partner, making the stress feel magnified and lonely.\n\nYou are dealing with a lot. It is absolutely okay that this is \"killing your mental health.\"\n\n### Addressing the Bottle Refusal\n\nYou are right that at 11 months, things change rapidly, and this could very well be a phase.\n\n**Reassurance:** Yes, this gets better. Yes, this is often a phase. Around 11-12 months, babies are hitting major milestones, their routines are changing, and their relationship with milk often changes as they transition rapidly to solids and cups.\n\nHere are a few things that might be happening, which could offer some clarity:\n\n*   **The Approach of the First Birthday:** At 12 months, the recommendation shifts from formula/breastmilk being the primary source of nutrition to solid foods and whole milk/water being the primary sources. Your baby may be naturally moving toward this transition earlier than expected.\n*   **Teething/Sore Gums:** Is your baby teething? Sometimes the suction required for a bottle can hurt sore gums or ears.\n*   **Distraction:** Is he too busy exploring the world? Daycare is a stimulating environment. He might be prioritizing play and interaction over sitting still for a bottle.\n*   **Preference Shift:** He knows he can get comfort and milk directly from you (nursing) and may be holding out for that.\n\n**If you are looking for practical ideas to try, here are some common strategies for this age group:**\n\n1.  **Introduce the Sippy Cup:** Since he is so close to 12 months, you could start offering expressed milk or formula in a sippy cup (straw or 360 type) instead of a bottle, especially at daycare. Sometimes the novelty of the cup helps.\n2.  **Mix Milk into Solids:** If milk intake is a concern, you can ensure he gets those calories by mixing the formula/expressed milk into his oatmeal, cereal, or purees.\n3.  **The \"Don't Force It\" Approach:** Often, the more stressed we are, the more tension the baby picks up. If he rejects the bottle, try again in 30 minutes, but don't turn it into a battle.\n\n***\n\n### Addressing the Emotional Load and Partner Support\n\nThis is perhaps the most important part of your vent right now. Feeling dismissed by your partner is incredibly painful, especially when you are doing the heavy lifting (handling the night wakings).\n\nYour partner may genuinely not understand the gravity because he didn't experience the initial trauma and doesn't deal with the night consequences. However, his lack of empathy is compounding your stress.\n\n**What you can do to try and bridge that gap (if you feel up to it):**\n\n1.  **State the Facts, Not Just the Feelings:** When you talk to him, try to frame it around the consequences he *can* understand. \"When he refuses the bottle, I worry about his weight, which triggers the anxiety I felt when he was a newborn. This results in me getting up 3 times a night to nurse, which means I am averaging 4 hours of broken sleep, and I need your help to recover.\"\n2.  **Delegate the Stressor:** If he doesn't take the bottle refusal seriously, ask him to take on the consequences. **\"I need you to take over the first night waking tonight, regardless of how he is fed. I need one full stretch of sleep.\"** If he experiences the difficulty of soothing a hungry, crying baby at 2 AM, it may shift his perspective.\n3.  **Seek Outside Validation:** You are already doing this here, which is great. But talking to a trusted friend, a lactation consultant (who can validate that this is a common, stressful phase), or a therapist can provide the external validation your husband isn't giving you.\n\n**You are not suffering silently or alone. You are a good parent who is reacting logically to a difficult situation that is triggering past trauma.**\n\nWhat would be most helpful for you right now? Are you interested in focusing more on practical tips for the baby, or perhaps strategies for managing the stress and communicating with your husband?"
