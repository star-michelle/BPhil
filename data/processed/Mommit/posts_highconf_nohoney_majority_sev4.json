    "title":"My mom kissed LO in front of me and denied it & physically touches him too much (imo). How serious is this?",
    "body":"I told my mom explicitly many times to not kiss my baby (4 months old) for hygiene purposes and it also just grosses me out. I have many bad memories of her making me kiss her on the cheek and lips and it makes me feel so so gross because I didn\u2019t feel like I had a choice when I was little (and I didn\u2019t want to). She also used to tickle and bite me a lot, she literally chased me around the house and did this to me on her bed and I screamed for my brother to help me get away but my mom took it all as a big joke and didn\u2019t stop until I was old enough to physically stop her. She is a school superintendent (for little kids) so I always figured she was right to do this to me (obviously she wasn\u2019t). \n\nAs LO gets older I\u2019ve stated noticing more concerning things she does. She seems to be getting more confident about her actions. Yesterday she was sitting with my baby and she kissed him on the top of his head. I was shocked and immediately said something like \u2018you cannot kiss LO, you just kissed him\u2019 and she said \u2018no I didn\u2019t\u2019 and acted all surprised. She also started to poke and tickle him and when I told her to stop, she asked why, I explained (bc even though he\u2019s a baby he probably does not enjoy that; he just can\u2019t control his arms enough to swat her away) and she rolled her eyes and disagreed but she did stop. \n\nHow seriously should I take all of this? Am I just being an overly cautious FTM? She\u2019s also made comments in front of me about biting his legs, and when I told her she can never do that she told my infant son that mommy needs to leave him alone with grandma for a while. \n\nI\u2019m huge on consent and always ask my son if I may kiss him on the belly or cheek before I do. I say the same thing \u2018May I give you a kiss?\u2019 and he knows what it means and usually smiles big and giggles, and if he ever doesn\u2019t enthusiastically smile when I ask, I don\u2019t kiss him. Some people laugh at me but I believe babies really can communicate this way. \n\nUp until these comments and kiss, she was our only trusted babysitter. But now I don\u2019t want to leave LO alone with her anymore. Am I overreacting? Is a kiss on the head no big deal if LO Is already 4 months old\/is this it\u2019s normal grandma behavior?\n\nETA She is amazing with LO otherwise, he smiles bigger when he sees her than when he sees me. He\u2019s obsessed with her. These physical oversteps just started within the last week (he\u2019s 4 months old) so I don\u2019t know if he understands or cares."

But it\u2019s just so hard. So hubs and I agreed 3 months minimum and maybe by the time I got there I\u2019d be able to keep going. \n\nJust over 3 more weeks to get to that benchmark and I am absolutely ready to let my supply dwindle if only to be able to get a full nights sleep without nursing or pumping. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m losing my mind in isolation. it feels like half my day is spent nursing or pumping and I get no reprieve in the outside world anymore which was keeping me going before. \n\nBut I can\u2019t stop the guilt either.

    "title":"How do I make this baby sleep please help me",
    "body":"As many of you can imagine, I am at my wits end. My healthy baby boy just does not sleep. He\u2019s king of the cat naps. He\u2019s two months. He\u2019ll take 15-20 minute naps 2-3 times a day and that\u2019s enough I guess???? Then at night we can usually get one decent 2-3 hr block out of him and then the second half of the night is a very fit full sleep where he\u2019s kind of up and down the whole time. Now we\u2019ve struggled with reflux but we\u2019re using a formula now that has helped a decent amount. And we know what it looks and sounds like if reflux is getting him up and it\u2019s not that very often anymore. Plus that I can understand. It seems like he\u2019ll have one day every 3-4 days where he sleeps like what I imagined babies sleep like- 3 nice long (2-3 hr) naps and then 2 decent blocks at night with two wake ups for food. Then the rest of the days are all cat naps and very little deep sleeps. We\u2019re sleep deprived but mostly just at a loss for what the hell to do. He\u2019s thriving, gaining weight, super healthy appetite. Besides the reflux, which is semi under control now, there\u2019s no obvious concern. We\u2019ve got every sleep option you can imagine- swing, vibrating seat, bouncing seat, inclined sleeper, flat bassinet, co sleeper... we\u2019ve swaddled and unswaddled. Lights out or dim lights, soothing music or silence, white noise and sleepy lights projected onto ceiling. Baths before bed, lavender bath and sheet spray. I\u2019m a FTM and admittedly clueless, but come onnnnn. I\u2019m going back to work very soon and I\u2019m panicked I\u2019m going to be a mess from the sleepless nights. Everyone keeps saying \u2018oh the first 3 months are brutal and then it gets better blah blah.\u2019 But I feel skeptical. And what the hell am I supposed to do until then? And what if the promised relief doesn\u2019t come? Do people survive this?! \n\nHELP ME MAKE THIS BABY SLEEP PLEASE!!!!! \n\nAddition- my mom seems to think that the baby is not satisfied by this \u2018thin\u2019 formula we are using. It seems like we feed him hourly. We always looks at each other and say \u2018he cannot be hungry again!\u2019 And he latches onto the nipple like we\u2019ve been starving him for weeks. I\u2019ve even started using premie nipples to slow down his guzzle. She suggested rice cereal in the bottle but the Internet has some horrible things to say about doing this. He\u2019s only 2 months and I\u2019m worried it\u2019s way too soon to introduce rice cereal. There\u2019s also reflux\/spit up prethickened formulas- anyone have thoughts on these? \n\nThanks "

    "title":"Why is it as the mom, I have to power through my illness but my spouse doesn\u2019t?",
    "body":"Rant incoming\n\nThis past week I (29F) have been sick with a fever, chills, body aches, a terrible sinus headache\/migraine and cough. My husband (30M) works 12 hour days and weekends, so I have been home with our 2yo and our 4mo. All this past week despite being sick, as the stay at home parent I\u2019ve had to power through and take care of our kids, cooking meals and making snack boxes so my husband has food to take to work for his long days, giving my kids baths, doing the bedtime routines, the grocery shopping, the laundry, the dishes, the overnight wakings and feedings with our 4mo. Then a few days ago our 2yo came down with a fever so I was waking up with her overnight too. Finally the weekend came and my husband promised it would be my turn to rest since I hadn\u2019t had a chance all week, and he knew I was still sick and exhausted. Well, naturally he comes down with food poisoning or some type of stomach\/gastrointestinal bug and is having diarrhea and vomiting all night. \n\nSo I continue waking with our infant overnight into the morning and then my husband took over from about 8-10:30. During that time he got both kids up, dressed, fed our toddler breakfast, fed our infant, fed our 2 dogs, let the dogs out and that was it. I wake up to the sounds of him yelling at our toddler to stop fighting him during a diaper change, and him calling me saying he needs wipes because she had a blowout and he doesn\u2019t have wipes. I bring down a pack of wipes and discover our toddler\u2019s blowout left poop on our infant\u2019s sit up chair which is hand wash only because it doesn\u2019t come apart, and our infant has had a blowout as well in his mamaroo which my husband didn\u2019t notice. I ask him if he has checked our toddler\u2019s temp because she has been running 100-102\u00b0 temperatures and he admits that no, he hasn\u2019t but he has checked his and he doesn\u2019t have a temp of his own. Which good for you but I\u2019m more worried about our child who can\u2019t advocate to get medicine on her own if she\u2019s not feeling well\u2026\n\nMy husband then falls asleep on the couch after the diaper change, and I\u2019m left to hand wash the sit-up chair, and handle the baby\u2019s blowout and clean the mamaroo insert. While my husband is napping, I empty the dishwasher, bring down and wash all the bottles from overnight, check our toddler\u2019s temperature, reload the dishwasher, check the baby\u2019s temperature to make sure he\u2019s not getting sick, take my own medicine, and get our infant\u2019s laundry started. Maybe I\u2019m just looking for a bone to pick but I\u2019m just feeling so frustrated because it feels like I\u2019ve had to power through this whole last week being under the weather, having no choice because our kids need me, but he\u2019s home now and he\u2019s here and capable and I get that he doesn\u2019t feel good became same, but he can\u2019t pick himself up just a little bit and show up even a little bit? Like am I asking or expecting too much? Am I being unreasonable or unfair? \n\nTL;DR \nI was sick this whole past week but because husband works 12 hour days, I had to take care of our 2yo and 4mo by myself while sick. My husband promised when the weekend came, I\u2019d be able to rest and he\u2019d watch the kids. Naturally Friday night he comes down with food poisoning or a gastro bug and ends up having diarrhea\/vomiting all night and has spent all but 2 hours napping. I\u2019m frustrated because what was supposed to be my turn to rest is just more of my time spent taking care of the kids while sick and exhausted. Am I being unreasonable or unrealistic in expecting and wishing that my husband power through his illness like I do mine, to parent our kids?"

    "body":"My boyfriend (27m) and I (29f) moved in together awhile ago with my two young children. I moved to his city for a job that pays pretty well. Like well over $5000 a month. I planned to pay off a lot of my debt and get my kids and I a lot of fun stuff we\u2019ve always been wanting. After a few weeks though my boyfriend stopped waking up in Time for work. He claims he just can\u2019t wake up. He has no idea why except he stays up till 2 am playing video games and watching tv every night. No different than before we lived together. After awhile he was making no money cuz he was just skipping work days. We decided he would just quit bc he got into a web dev program that\u2019s supposed to be done in 9 months. I was happy at first because I figured I\u2019d have more time to spend with him. But he won\u2019t wake up. He says he \u201ccant\u201d wake up. If he agrees to take my son to school in the morning I have to set an alarm to wake up myself wake up my son and get him ready and then I have to wake my boyfriend up because \u201che cant\u201d supposedly even though he had no trouble at all before we moved in together. Meanwhile I have been footing his outrageous bills. I have two kids and my bills are nil. His are over $1000 a month. Which I\u2019m fine with but he stays in bed till I wake him up and I have to repeatedly do so. He watches my kids over the weekend while I work nightshift 6pm to 7am. I don\u2019t get home till 8\/830 every morning and I\u2019m exhausted. I come home to an absolute disaster in my home and my young child being up for hours without supervision bc he will not get out of bed. I\u2019ve worked really hard to get where I am and I work tirelessly to keep it nice and tidy in our home but he hardly lifts a finger. When he\u2019s with us, he\u2019s on his phone. He plays with my kids sometimes. But for the most part he\u2019s lost in his phone. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked him to help more around the house bc I\u2019m tired as hell and physically my body is breaking from all the work. But nothing has changed at all. I think that if I work 40+ hours, do all the housework and most of the parenting, then he can do 20 hours of school, an equal amount of housework and parenting but evidently that\u2019s too much to ask of him? According to him he \u201ccleans a lot\u201d but I don\u2019t see it. There\u2019s trash everywhere, unfinished food sitting out, piles of unfolded laundry, dirty floors, full sink no matter how much I do, I feel like I\u2019m just being shit on at every turn. There\u2019s a lot more issues but this is the main one. I have a two year contract at my company and he watches my kids or else I wouldn\u2019t be making as much money. I\u2019m only 6 months in to the job and I want out, I want to go back to being just me and my boys."

Before I had my baby, my pets were my life. My babies. I foster failed these kittens because I couldn\u2019t handle giving them away, and it\u2019s not any easier now 5 years later. If I had known then what I know now, I would\u2019ve adopted them out as kittens. Hindsight is 20\/20. My husband and I now have a very difficult decision to make. "

He refuses to drink them at daycare and barely tolerates them at home. This has been causing me a lot of stress, especially because he lost a lot of weight when he was first born and I struggled with nursing initially. The first few weeks of his life were super traumatic for me and I realize I'm still carrying a lot of that.\n\nThis has also resulted in him waking up super hungry at night when he didn't used to, which is hardest on me because I handle nights since it's easier to just nurse him than heat a bottle that he might reject anyways. \n\nMy husband is great and tries to be supportive, but it frustrates me that he just doesn't take this seriously. He thinks I'm stressing for no reason, and even seems annoyed when I talk about it with him because I bring it up constantly. He can't empathize with where I'm coming from and he doesn't deal with the consequences directly, so I feel super helpless and like I need to just suffer silently and alone.\n\nI don't know what I'm looking for here.

    "title":"Is my best friend jealous of a toddler?",
    "body":"My best friend and I have known each other 20 years, and during this time, we have taken care of each other, gone on trips, engaged in creative endeavors together, and allowed ourselves room to grow, but I gave birth three years ago, and this year my husband lost his job. In the time since, things have gotten incredibly tense at home, and I have gone on a heavy medication regimen to deal with my anxiety and bipolar disorder. I have become disengaged from my home life and I have become too involved in my best friend\u2019s life. I have absorbed their problems, and not addressed any of my own. My husband recently got another job, and with 2024 on the horizon, I knew I needed to address this issue with my best friend.\n\nRight after my husband lost his job, I invited my best friend over my house on Wednesday nights for dinner and while it was enjoyable at first, over the course of the last few months, my best friend would come into my house and immediately unload about the work day in front of my toddler, sometimes would have emotional outbursts, and I would take care of them and ignore my daughter. I didn\u2019t realize how much I was doing this, but I did notice that I was beginning to get uncomfortable around my best friend. I couldn\u2019t figure out why I was feeling uncomfortable, or distant, and I just kept talking to them as if nothing was the problem. My best friend had done several things over the course of these last three years that have crossed boundaries, the biggest one being posting pictures of my daughter online (I literally cut my dad out of my life because he couldn\u2019t agree to keep my kid off Facebook), and I never brought it up because I am afraid to. I am having these revelations now, and after speaking with my therapist, she recommended slowly backing away, which isn\u2019t something that will work with my best friend. They\u2019re enmeshed in my life, and I needed to inform them that I had to change my behavior.\n\nDuring a phone call with my best friend on Thursday night, I expressed to them that I had been prioritizing them over my husband and child. To start, I told them that the Wednesday night dinners needed to end because my daughter is going through a sleep regression and having a guest over on the week is really making the process more difficult. Once I said that the conversation got more tense. Eventually, once I said that I need to prioritize my husband and child, my best friend said that \u201chow is that my fault?\u201d Which is not the answer I was expecting. I stuttered and stumbled over my words. I didn\u2019t know how to speak to them. They were crying, I just wanted to let them know that I need to put my daughter first, and in between cries they went \u201cI know obviously, it just hurts.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m angry, quite frankly. I didn\u2019t expect this reaction and I don\u2019t know where to go from here. I\u2019m not saying anything that isn\u2019t a fact. I love my daughter more than my best friend because yeah, of course I do. I gave birth to her. She\u2019s the priority. I haven\u2019t been treating her like one and I need to make the effort now. \n\nDuring the conversation, my anxiety was so high and I didn\u2019t know what to do, so I just said that we\u2019re both in a bad place so it makes sense that this confrontation happened. I told my best friend I just needed space to be with my family and to work to heal together. Like I said, things are rough at home right now and I\u2019ve been ignoring my problems to deal with my best friend.\n\nI received texts everyday since that conversation, and I finally told them today we need to talk in person. What do you recommend I say? What is the brain space of someone who is hurt by the sentence \u201cI need to put my daughter first\u201d? This is my closest friend so to not be allowed the space to focus on my family is just gut wrenching and I just want to simultaneously scream and yell and cry. Why are they acting like this? We went to different colleges and didn\u2019t talk every day and still called each other best friends over a decade ago, so to ask for space now and to not be given it, I don\u2019t know what to do."

Now when he sees me he just wants to breastfeed. If he\u2019s near me he\u2019s immediately agitated, pulling my shirt and grabbing my breasts. If I don\u2019t feed him he gets more and more upset and crying. He doesn\u2019t even want to feed, just be attached to me.  I\u2019m always a patient person and I\u2019ve never felt frustrated with him before, but now sometimes I feel so hurt and angry. He\u2019s happy and giggly for everyone else, but with me it\u2019s not like that **at all** anymore. My baby just wants my boob. He can go from perfectly fine to seeing me and wailing in 2 seconds. It\u2019s every single time, every day, and it\u2019s just breaking me.\n\nI feel numb. I know it\u2019s not his fault. I know he wants to be close to me, but I just feel like a source of nutrition. It\u2019s so hard to see him only be my happy boy with his Dad.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that I have in-laws staying and you can cut the tension with a knife. It\u2019s not helping hearing about all the little things each day that he\u2019s done and how much fun he was. I know I should be glad, but I feel worse. I feel like I\u2019ve lost something special.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. Has anyone been here? Does it get better?"

    "body":"Hi moms. I (39) am a full-time working mom of a 2.5 yo. Around 6-7 months post partum, I was suddenly hit with the thought from out of nowhere, while kissing and cuddling with my baby, that there may be another baby\/babies like him who may be neglected, abused and unloved right that moment. It was a gut-punching guilt and for another couple of weeks, I had it in my mind 24x7. I tried donating to local charities caring for kids and Non-profits back in my home country but it obviously didn\u2019t help. This kept happening on and off until he started daycare at 13 months, at which point, I became too busy with work and I almost stopped having time for anything other than routine life. \n\nBut 2 nights back, while cuddling and talking to my son while putting him to bed, he had his usual belly laugh and all of a sudden the old guilt came back. Since then I haven\u2019t been able to sleep normally. During the day, while working, I have to listen to some music to keep my thoughts distracted. Last 2 nights and tonight, I am watching some crap on YouTube until I tire out to sleep. \n\nHave any of you had similar experiences? Is this normal?\n\nUPDATE: Thank you all so much for your advice and sharing your experiences. It felt better to know that a lot of us go through this. I met with my Doctor last week. Ended up breaking down and crying in her office. Got referred to a therapist. Will be meeting her next week."

Guess where I was? Yep, home with the kids. \n\nI\u2019d done my best to try and find a sitter but I couldn\u2019t. And DH didn\u2019t say anything about a sitter too, just that it sucks I can\u2019t be there. I could have\u2026 if he tried to find a sitter, too. Or at the very least send videos of the performance, instead I saw pics and short clips on FB and Insta. \n\nTo say I\u2019m crushed in an understatement. I don\u2019t get to go out a lot already and I stressed how much it\u2019d mean to me to be there for our first ever live music event to DH. I think I\u2019m understandably upset. \n\nSo when DH asked me why I\u2019m so bummed out this morning I told him I feel a little left out and sad I couldn\u2019t be there last night. Lately I\u2019ve been struggling with not working anymore and even just not being there to help with service fills me with so much guilt. \n\nWell, he took it personally. Like, hard. He said I have no reason to complain as we both tried and it didn\u2019t work out. \u201cYou\u2019re acting like an entitled bitch for not getting your way.\u201d I could see it in his eyes as soon as he said it he didn\u2019t mean it, but the damage is done. \n\nI\u2019m an entitled bitch for feeling left out. Okay. He apologized for saying it, he didn\u2019t mean a word of it he just got caught up in the moment, but I didn\u2019t believe him. He\u2019s disrespected me before in arguments. This is the last straw. I\u2019m not leaving him or anything but damn, that hurt. A lot. It\u2019s going to take some time for me to even look at him without wanting to cry. I know it\u2019s not true but it hurts knowing he thinks that about me. \n\nI gave up so much to be a stay at home mom. I worked 2 good jobs, aspired to attend college or uni, I used to be a decent author\u2026 that all stopped when I got pregnant with our oldest. And ever since having our kids my health has gotten so bad. I usually don\u2019t complain, it\u2019s just that lately it\u2019s been hitting me hard that outside of having my kids I have no real achievements to celebrate. Woo, I made it out of poor family situation as a kid, yay! But I wanted to much more for myself. Grief is a fickle thing, I\u2019m only human and I can\u2019t help it. But I\u2019m entitled for feeling bad? For leaving left behind at home? \n\nIdk. My heart hurts and I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to face him later. I can\u2019t stop crying, even after taking my prescribed anxiety meds. How I do I move on from this? Can we? "

It started with intrusive thoughts, which got more intense and intrusive as the weeks went by (and are so irrational and terrible they are not worth repeating). Now I'm noticing it spike right at bedtime and it comes with physical symptoms like a racing heart and shortness of breath. Last night was the first night I woke up in the middle of the night because I was so anxious (and stayed awake). I'm finding it more and more difficult to emotionally motivate myself to get out so I'm staying in the house for days at a time.\n\nWhen my anxiety was very high before I was pregnant, it manifested as panic attacks, insomnia, and generalized stress that kept me in the house. I felt worried about things when my baby aS first born but they were rational and didn't control me. Now it feels like the anxiety is taking over, and it feels like it's newly-developed.\n\nI've read a lot about postpartum depression but not so much about this anxiety.

She has been with grandma while I was at the hospital and was having a great time; but now that I'm back she desperately wants mama to herself. She constantly wants to be picked up and sit on my lap and when she doesn't get her way she breaks into long, intense tantrums. She cries every time she sees me. My husband and mother in law are insistent that she cry it out and I don't give in and give her the love she needs, but it is breaking me. I feel like it is too much change too fast, and that we need to be gentler with her and the transition. We can work on teaching lessons once her mom love cup is filled up and she knows that I am still here and love her unconditionally. \n\nI should be napping but instead I am in bed crying, feeling like like I've gained a baby boy but lost my little girl in the process. \n\nFor context: I had been on mat leave with our toddler for 18 months throughout the pandemic, with very little help or socialization nearby. Of course we are extremely attached. \n\nWhat do you think I should do? If I stay strong through the tantrums will it get better? Open to any and all advice on how to get through this. \n\nThis mom thanks you for the support.\n\n\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for taking the time to share your experiences and reassure me that it will get better. Husband has stepped up immensely and is spending all day every day with toddler doing fun activities. In between I am spending as much special time as I can with her and the crying is less and less every day. She is learning to be a big girl, with mom and dad helping her every step of the way. My hormones have leveled out and I'm no longer the sobbing fit I was when my milk came in, thank God. Next week my mom is coming to help and then its going to be just myself and the two babies figuring it out together. As hard as its going to be, I am looking forward to being just the 3 of us so the toddler knows that she is not being taken away from mommy and that she is a vital part of the team, taking care of baby. Until then I'm trying to rest up as much as possible because I know it's going to be the biggest challenge of my life, keeping both alive and happy! Wish me luck! \n\nThank you again for all the support. Feeling the love."

I\u2019m assuming she didn\u2019t drink for eight hours either, because she had a hard, dehydration-induced poop stuck halfway out that hasn\u2019t been changed.
