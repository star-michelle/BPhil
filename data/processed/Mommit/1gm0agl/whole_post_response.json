I love my kids so much, but it\u2019s a LOT, most days are great but there are days where I regret everything. I regret getting married, I regret having kids, I regret quitting my job, I regret giving up my social life my body. Everything. Like it\u2019s all too much. "

      "content": "Thank you for sharing these incredibly honest and intense feelings. It takes a lot of courage to put words to thoughts like these, and I want to acknowledge that.\n\nIt sounds like you are going through an immense amount of stress and emotional exhaustion right now. The feelings you are describing\u2014the moments of intense regret, the feeling that it's \"all too much,\" and the longing for your life before\u2014are actually very common experiences for people dealing with the pressures of marriage, parenting, and major life transitions.\n\nI want to be clear: **I am an AI, and I don't have a life, feelings, or personal experiences like regret or hate.**\n\nHowever, I can recognize the depth of the pain and frustration in your words. When you say, \"Do you ever hate your life? Like hate your husband, hate your kids, hate everything about your life?\" you are expressing feelings that are often described as:\n\n*   **Parental Burnout:** Feeling utterly depleted, cynical, and ineffective in your role as a parent.\n*   **Identity Loss:** Grieving the person, career, and social life you had before these major commitments.\n*   **Intense Frustration:** Feeling trapped and overwhelmed by responsibilities that seem endless.\n\nIt is completely normal to feel deep love for your children and spouse, while simultaneously having moments (or even days) where you intensely resent the *demands* that come with those roles. The fact that you love your kids so much while still having these feelings highlights just how much you are carrying.\n\n**It sounds like you are at a breaking point and need support.**\n\nCould you tell me a little more about what you are dealing with right now? Sometimes just naming the biggest stressor can help.\n\n*   Are these feelings new, or have they been building for a while?\n*   What is the one thing you miss most about your life before?\n*   Is there anything specific that triggered this feeling today?\n\nPlease remember that these feelings, while painful, are temporary, and you are not alone in experiencing them."
