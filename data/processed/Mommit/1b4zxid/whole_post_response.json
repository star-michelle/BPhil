      "content": "Why is it as the mom, I have to power through my illness but my spouse doesn\u2019t?\n\nRant incoming\n\nThis past week I (29F) have been sick with a fever, chills, body aches, a terrible sinus headache/migraine and cough. My husband (30M) works 12 hour days and weekends, so I have been home with our 2yo and our 4mo. All this past week despite being sick, as the stay at home parent I\u2019ve had to power through and take care of our kids, cooking meals and making snack boxes so my husband has food to take to work for his long days, giving my kids baths, doing the bedtime routines, the grocery shopping, the laundry, the dishes, the overnight wakings and feedings with our 4mo. Then a few days ago our 2yo came down with a fever so I was waking up with her overnight too. Finally the weekend came and my husband promised it would be my turn to rest since I hadn\u2019t had a chance all week, and he knew I was still sick and exhausted. Well, naturally he comes down with food poisoning or some type of stomach/gastrointestinal bug and is having diarrhea and vomiting all night. \n\nSo I continue waking with our infant overnight into the morning and then my husband took over from about 8-10:30. During that time he got both kids up, dressed, fed our toddler breakfast, fed our infant, fed our 2 dogs, let the dogs out and that was it. I wake up to the sounds of him yelling at our toddler to stop fighting him during a diaper change, and him calling me saying he needs wipes because she had a blowout and he doesn\u2019t have wipes. I bring down a pack of wipes and discover our toddler\u2019s blowout left poop on our infant\u2019s sit up chair which is hand wash only because it doesn\u2019t come apart, and our infant has had a blowout as well in his mamaroo which my husband didn\u2019t notice. I ask him if he has checked our toddler\u2019s temp because she has been running 100-102\u00b0 temperatures and he admits that no, he hasn\u2019t but he has checked his and he doesn\u2019t have a temp of his own. Which good for you but I\u2019m more worried about our child who can\u2019t advocate to get medicine on her own if she\u2019s not feeling well\u2026\n\nMy husband then falls asleep on the couch after the diaper change, and I\u2019m left to hand wash the sit-up chair, and handle the baby\u2019s blowout and clean the mamaroo insert. While my husband is napping, I empty the dishwasher, bring down and wash all the bottles from overnight, check our toddler\u2019s temperature, reload the dishwasher, check the baby\u2019s temperature to make sure he\u2019s not getting sick, take my own medicine, and get our infant\u2019s laundry started. Maybe I\u2019m just looking for a bone to pick but I\u2019m just feeling so frustrated because it feels like I\u2019ve had to power through this whole last week being under the weather, having no choice because our kids need me, but he\u2019s home now and he\u2019s here and capable and I get that he doesn\u2019t feel good became same, but he can\u2019t pick himself up just a little bit and show up even a little bit? Like am I asking or expecting too much? Am I being unreasonable or unfair? \n\nTL;DR \nI was sick this whole past week but because husband works 12 hour days, I had to take care of our 2yo and 4mo by myself while sick. My husband promised when the weekend came, I\u2019d be able to rest and he\u2019d watch the kids. Naturally Friday night he comes down with food poisoning or a gastro bug and ends up having diarrhea/vomiting all night and has spent all but 2 hours napping. I\u2019m frustrated because what was supposed to be my turn to rest is just more of my time spent taking care of the kids while sick and exhausted. Am I being unreasonable or unrealistic in expecting and wishing that my husband power through his illness like I do mine, to parent our kids?"

      "content": "Oh my goodness. I am so incredibly sorry that you are going through this right now. That sounds like an absolutely exhausting, frustrating, and incredibly unfair situation.\n\nPlease know that **you are not being unreasonable, unrealistic, or unfair.** What you are feeling is completely valid. It is infuriating to feel like you are the only one who is ever expected to \"power through\" illness and exhaustion, while your partner gets to completely check out when they feel unwell\u2014even when it's supposed to be your designated time to rest.\n\nIt sounds like you have been running on empty for an entire week, managing two very young children (one of whom is also sick), keeping the house running, *and* making sure your husband is taken care of for his long workdays. That is an enormous burden for anyone, let alone someone who is battling a fever and body aches.\n\n### The Double Standard is Real\n\nWhat you are describing is a pervasive and very real issue that often falls along gender lines, especially in households where one parent is the primary caregiver (like a stay-at-home parent).\n\nWhen a mom gets sick, the expectation often seems to be that the kids still need to be fed, the laundry still needs to be done, and the world can't stop. When a dad gets sick (or even just stressed or tired), the expectation often seems to be that he gets to retreat and recover, and the primary caregiver will step in to cover everything.\n\nYou are witnessing this double standard play out in real-time, and it's devastating when you were counting on that promised relief.\n\n### What You Can Do Right Now\n\nBefore thinking about long-term solutions, you need immediate relief. Your body and mind deserve a break.\n\n1.  **Prioritize the Essentials (and only the essentials):** Forget the dishwasher, the grocery shopping, and the snack boxes for today. Focus only on the bare minimum: keeping the kids safe, fed, and medicated (especially your 2yo).\n2.  **Communicate (if you have the energy):** If you can manage it, you need to tell your husband exactly what you need, even if he is feeling sick. He needs to know that his illness does not erase his parental responsibilities, especially when you are also still sick.\n    *   A simple text or note might be easier than a confrontation: \"I am still sick and exhausted. I need you to take Tylenol/Advil and handle the kids from [time] to [time] so I can lie down for 90 minutes. I will take the overnight feedings/wakeups, but I need daytime rest.\"\n3.  **Use Screen Time/Safe Spaces:** If necessary, utilize safe screen time (TV, tablet) for your 2yo to keep her contained and entertained while you rest with the infant, or put the infant down for a nap while you sit quietly with your toddler. Survival mode is okay right now.\n4.  **Order In:** If you can swing it financially, order delivery for dinner tonight. One less thing to cook or clean up.\n\n### Looking Ahead: Addressing the Imbalance\n\nOnce you are both feeling a little better, this needs to be a serious conversation, because this dynamic will continue unless it is addressed directly.\n\nIt sounds like your husband might be operating under the assumption that since he works long hours, his home time is for recovery, regardless of the workload you carry during the day. This needs to be reframed: **Parenting is a shared responsibility, and illness does not make one parent exempt while the other is still forced to function.**\n\nWhen you talk to him, focus on how his actions affected *you* and the children:\n\n*   **Focus on the facts:** \"When you fell asleep on the couch, I was left to handle two major blowouts, clean hand-wash items, and start laundry, all while still sick. I also noticed you didn't check our daughter's temperature, which was worrying because she has been running a high fever.\"\n*   **Establish a \"Sick Parent Protocol\":** You need to define what happens when *either* parent is sick. For example:\n    *   If the SAHP is sick, the working parent takes over immediately upon coming home and handles all nighttime wakeups.\n    *   If the working parent is sick, the SAHP still needs relief time. The working parent takes over for defined blocks (e.g., 6 PM - 8 PM and 8 AM - 10 AM) even if they are just resting quietly with the kids nearby.\n    *   If both parents are sick, all non-essential chores stop, and you focus on tag-teaming 2-hour shifts so both of you get breaks.\n\nYour feelings of anger and frustration are 100% justified. You are exhausted, you were let down, and you deserve a partner who recognizes that being a stay-at-home parent is a 24/7 job that doesn't stop just because the primary caregiver is ill.\n\nWhat kind of support are you looking for right now? Do you need strategies for getting rest, or are you mostly looking for validation that your feelings are warranted?"
