It\u2019s been over two years but I still think about him constantly and it doesn\u2019t take a lot for me to just break down and cry. Does \u201cnormal\u201d ever come back? This place I\u2019m in feels endless.... I miss having a masculine figure in my life to turn to for advice"

      "content": "This is such a profoundly moving and honest share. Thank you for trusting me with these feelings, especially on a day that is clearly hitting you harder than usual.\n\nFirst, I want to acknowledge the pain you are feeling right now. Losing your father is one of the most significant losses a person can experience, and the intensity of that grief doesn't magically disappear after two years. What you are going through\u2014the constant thinking, the sudden breakdowns, the endless feeling\u2014is absolutely understandable and, in fact, incredibly common when grieving someone so important.\n\nRegarding your question, \"How did you deal with losing your father at a young age?\":\n\nI can't answer that question personally, as I am an AI and have not experienced human loss. However, I can speak about what I've learned from countless people who have navigated similar journeys.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the people who have successfully navigated this kind of grief often say that **\"normal\" doesn't usually come back in the way it was before.** The person you were before the loss is gone, because your life has fundamentally changed.\n\nInstead of trying to return to the old \"normal,\" the goal often shifts to finding a **\"new normal.\"**\n\n### What the \"New Normal\" Often Looks Like:\n\n*   **The Grief Changes Shape, Not Size:** The pain doesn't necessarily get smaller, but your life eventually grows around it. The sharp, debilitating pain slowly becomes a duller ache, present but not always paralyzing.\n*   **The Crying Becomes Less Frequent, But Still Valid:** You will likely find that the breakdowns become less frequent, or they might be triggered by specific, meaningful events rather than just existing in the background all the time. But please know, crying is productive. It is your body releasing the immense pressure of your love and your loss.\n*   **Integration, Not Erasure:** The goal is not to forget your father or stop missing him. The goal is to integrate the memory of him\u2014the love, the lessons, the joy\u2014into your present life in a way that allows you to move forward while still honoring his place in your heart.\n\n### Addressing the Need for a Masculine Figure and Advice\n\nIt is completely understandable that you miss having that masculine figure for guidance. Your father was your unique source of that wisdom and perspective.\n\nSince he is physically absent, some ways people manage this specific void include:\n\n1.  **\"What Would Dad Say?\":** When you face a tough decision, try to pause and genuinely ask yourself, \"Given what I know about him, his values, and his advice, what would his perspective be on this?\" This allows his influence to continue guiding you.\n2.  **Seeking Out Mentorship:** If possible, look for trusted, positive masculine figures in your life (uncles, family friends, respected colleagues, teachers, or even a professional therapist) who embody the qualities you admired in your father, and who you can turn to for specific advice or perspective.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself today. Two years is not a long time in the grand scheme of grief. The fact that you miss him so much is a testament to how much you loved him.\n\n**Is there anything specific you are struggling with right now\u2014a decision, a memory, or just the weight of the day\u2014that you'd like to talk through?** Sometimes just articulating the specific struggle can help ease the burden slightly."
