I had a fallout with some close friends and it made me distrust everyone that was close to me. As a result, I hadn\u2019t had a single relationship last long in the past few years. It makes me think there is something wrong with me as I always used to have friends. \n\nI resorted to friends after college who rarely would hit me up to chill. I\u2019d always have to hit them up. Eventually I got booted from the group due to beef with some members. I got into a tussle with a guy for play and ended up getting hurt. I told him and he just made it seem like I was overreacting.  After that I distrusted the whole group. \n\nI ended up not keeping in touch with the group much recently. I had some close childhood friends in that group, but they\u2019d rather chill with them than me nowadays. As soon as I sensed this, I developed some hate towards my former friends.\n\nNowadays, I get drunk and try and solve issues through text with friends. It has made me create a toxic relationship towards friends. Now I\u2019m willing to call out friends for their fake ness as soon as shit hit the fan. I\u2019m tired of fake friends and I\u2019m aggressively trying to lose them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is good or not. I can tell when a friend eventually turns into an acquaintance because they\u2019d rather chill with new people and not bother keeping in touch with me. And it\u2019s not always their fault I guess, sometimes they are so busy to reply.\n\nBut it always hits me personally. So I end up drinking a lot one night, and venting my concerned about the relationship to all these friends. But they look at me like I\u2019m crazy and gives them more of a reason to avoid me. For instance, my friend went on a trip this past weekend, they didn\u2019t even mention it to me. They had planned it behind my back and they didn\u2019t even care enough to include me. I don\u2019t even like to call them my friends because I know deep down they don\u2019t care.\n\n The thing is that the one guy who I\u2019m closest with, hits me up when it\u2019s convenient for him. But he doesn\u2019t hit me up otherwise unless I remind him. He even told me he was busy last weekend, he posts on his story chilling with a friend and his gf. But he tells me he couldn\u2019t chill, which just makes me have trust issues. The truth is that I can\u2019t connect with them without weed or beer so it makes me think of I\u2019m truly their friends."

      "content": "This sounds like a really painful and confusing time, and I want to acknowledge how much courage it takes to lay all of this out. It\u2019s completely understandable that you are struggling with anger and trust issues given the series of painful fallouts you\u2019ve experienced.\n\nBefore we dive into your specific question about whether it\u2019s better to \u201cgo off\u201d on fake friends, let\u2019s first address the core feelings and patterns you\u2019ve described, as they are all connected.\n\nIt sounds like you are experiencing a huge amount of hurt, rejection, and betrayal, and that hurt is coming out as anger and aggressive attempts to regain control of the situation.\n\n---\n\n### Addressing the Core Question: Is it better to \"go off\" on fake friends?\n\nYou are asking if aggressively cutting off or confronting friends for their \"fakeness\" is a good strategy.\n\n**In short: Usually, no, it is not the most effective strategy, especially if the goal is to feel better, build healthier relationships, and reduce your own distress.**\n\nHere is why:\n\n#### 1. It Escalates Conflict, Not Resolution\nWhen you \"go off\" (especially when intoxicated, as you mentioned), it tends to confirm the distance the other person is already feeling. They don\u2019t see a friend expressing pain; they see an aggressive person creating drama, which reinforces their decision to keep their distance. As you noted: \"But they look at me like I\u2019m crazy and gives them more of a reason to avoid me.\"\n\n#### 2. It Doesn't Solve the Underlying Trust Issue\nThe desire to aggressively confront them comes from a deep need for validation and clarity (\"Do you care about me?\"). Texting them when you are drunk only provides a temporary release of anger, but it doesn\u2019t actually give you the closure or the trustworthy connections you are craving. It often leads to more regret and deeper feelings of isolation the next day.\n\n#### 3. It Damages Your Reputation and Future Connections\nIf you are repeatedly known for having explosive, text-based arguments with friends, it makes people hesitant to get close to you in the future. You are trying to lose the \"fake\" friends, but this method often pushes away the potentially genuine ones, too.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Pattern You Described\n\nIt sounds like you are stuck in a cycle where your fear of abandonment triggers an aggressive response, which then causes the abandonment you feared in the first place.\n\n1. **Sensing Distance/Rejection:** (Friend doesn't text, friend goes on a trip without you, friend says he's busy but posts pictures.)\n2. **Internalizing the Pain/Betrayal:** (\"They don\u2019t care. There is something wrong with me.\")\n3. **Self-Medicating/Escalation:** (Drinking heavily and venting concerns aggressively via text.)\n4. **Result:** (Friends pull away further, confirming your initial fear, leading to more anger and distrust.)\n\n#### On the Subject of \"Fake Friends\"\n\nIt\u2019s important to recognize that friendships often change and fade over time, especially in your mid-twenties. People get busy, priorities shift (jobs, relationships, new hobbies), and sometimes people simply grow apart.\n\nWhile some of these friends may indeed be acting insensitively (like planning a trip without mentioning it), others might just be prioritizing other relationships or commitments. **It hits you personally because you are relying on these people to fill a deep need for connection and trust, and when they fail, it feels like a personal indictment of your worth.**\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Steps Forward\n\nYou are almost 25, and this is a perfect time to start building healthier coping mechanisms and relationships. This is absolutely fixable, but it requires shifting your focus from managing *their* behavior to managing *your* reaction and building *your* own stability.\n\n#### 1. Stop Texting When Drunk (The Most Critical Step)\nThis is non-negotiable for improving your relationships and your mental health. The drunk texts are destroying your friendships and creating unnecessary drama.\n\n**Strategy:** If you feel the urge to drink and vent, put your phone away, write your feelings down in a journal, or reach out to a support system that is *not* the people you are angry at (a family member, a therapist, or a support line).\n\n#### 2. Manage Your Anger and Trust Issues Proactively\nYou mentioned struggling with anger and trust issues. These are often best addressed with professional support:\n\n* **Therapy (Counseling):** A therapist can help you unpack the initial trauma (the fallout from your close friends) and teach you healthier ways to process rejection, manage anger, and rebuild trust (both in yourself and others). This is the best place to vent your feelings safely.\n* **Focus on Emotional Regulation:** Learn tools to soothe yourself when you feel the pang of rejection instead of escalating to anger.\n\n#### 3. Shift from Confrontation to Quiet Distancing\nInstead of aggressively \"losing\" fake friends, adopt a strategy of **Quiet Distancing** from those who are not meeting your needs.\n\n* **Don't Engage:** If a friend only hits you up when convenient, stop chasing them. Don't confront them; simply stop initiating contact. Let the relationship naturally settle into the level of effort they are willing to provide (which might be zero).\n* **Set Clear Boundaries (Soberly):** If you must address something, do it calmly and soberly, focusing on your needs, not their faults. (e.g., \"Hey, I noticed we only hang out when we are smoking/drinking. I'm trying to cut back, so let me know if you want to grab coffee sometime instead.\")\n\n#### 4. Build New, Healthier Connections\nYou mentioned that your only way to connect with your current friends is through weed or beer. This is a sign that those relationships are built on shared activity rather than shared values or genuine connection.\n\n* **Focus on Activities that Don't Involve Substances:** Join clubs, take classes, volunteer, or start a new hobby that forces you to meet people in sober environments. These connections often lead to deeper, more sustainable friendships.\n* **Look for Reciprocity:** When building new relationships, pay attention to how much effort they put in. A healthy friendship involves both people reaching out and caring about the other\u2019s life.\n\nIt sounds like you have a lot of passion and a deep desire for loyalty. Those are excellent qualities. The goal now is to channel that passion into building a life and a support network that truly values you, rather than spending energy fighting battles with people who are already checked out.\n\n**How does all of this sound to you? Are there any specific parts of this situation you'd like to explore further, perhaps the challenge of finding new friends?**"
