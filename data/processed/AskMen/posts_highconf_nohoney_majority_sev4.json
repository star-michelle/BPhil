    "title":"Is it a red flag that the man I am dating won't speak to me over an NFL game?",
    "body":"Context on our situation:\n\nWe are in our late 20s. We are in the beginning stages of dating; ~4 months in. Haven't officially discussed exclusivity, but for the sake of discussion and simplicity let's say we are steadily approaching that level. However... still in that fragile getting to know each other's strengths and flaws stage. This is also long distance; that could be an important fact.\n\n\nDetails of my questions:\n\nOur teams are HUGE rivals. Whenever they play each other we both talk shit; it's a lot of fun, and we love to talk about how \"taboo\" we are. Anyway, his team lost to mine last night, AT their home field, in the playoffs. I did NOT rub it in because as much as I love football, he cares way more than I do. In fact, I didn't text a single thing to him during or post game. I respect him enough to not be a douche bag about it. \n\n\nHowever now he won't talk to me. He literally told me he won't, and he is following through. At first I considered it a continuation of our running \"sleeping with the enemy\" joke, but he's taken it to a new level with punishing me for a football game... I feel ridiculous even verbalizing that this is an issue, but should I consider it a red flag in his behavior? I have no idea when he will text\/call me again. He's effectively ruined my enjoyment of my teams victory by acting like a sore, salty-ass loser and I'm afraid that if I were to eventually be in a relationship with this person, this pouty behavior would be too common and cause problems. Do I tell him now that he is making me feel sad that now I can't even talk to the one person I want to? Or do I wait for him to finish licking his wounds?\n\n\nOn the other hand, am I thinking too much about it? I am prone to that, which is why I bring this question to the collective here. Thanks if you read this, I appreciate any feedback. "

    "title":"Disability, anxiety, and dating\/hookups. May I have some advice on all fronts, no matter how much you can\/can't relate please?",
    "body":"Sorry! This post ended up being much longer than I expected, but I feel like it's all pretty important because I still have these issues\/thoughts about anyone and everyone else that I'm interested in. And a lot of this sounds like you have to explain it to me like I'm a five year old, and I'd honestly prefer it if you did. I'll always be willing to look dumb in the pursuit of improvement. I'm hoping that this is just a unique enough situation to warrant this post not violating rule 4.\n\nI'm a 26 year old physically disabled guy. I have a muscular condition, which is essentially like ALS, but not AS severe in my case. Because I've been shy and anxious ever since I can remember, I never really got \"broken out of my shell\". On Tinder I've switched up the way I interact with women. In essence, I do my best to entirely ignore my anxiety and just go balls to the wall with my personality and I say things that are completely fine (likely) to say, but if I listened to my anxiety, I would never. It's working out pretty well! Fake it til you make it style.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, I still do have anxiety, and I'm even more inexperienced than you can imagine. For example, I'm not physically strong enough to do the five knuckle shuffle myself, so nudes don't really do much for me. I mean. They do, but I can't do anything about it which has led me to basically look at nudes through an artistic appreciation lens if that makes any sense. Anxiety, the no 5 knuckle shuffle, and the inexperience make me absolutely fucking awful at dirty talk. (How do you all know what they want to hear during impromptu dirty talk that you initiate?) So! I of course second guess myself a lot. Some of these questions might have painfully obvious answers, but, again, anxiety. And others aren't as obvious, but I would love to hear people's thoughts.\n\nI know that I don't look all that attractive physically to most, but I don't even care about that, because if just my looks are a deal breaker, then I consider that a dodged bullet for sure. A lot of my charm is my jokes and me being smooth. I do super well over text, but thinking about saying certain stuff in person with my limitations doesn't sound very smooth. For example, I've been talking to a girl on Tinder for a few weeks and I've told her that given the opportunity, I would love to \"tap that ass into orbit\". That was also pretty early on, she's still seemingly interested, and she lives about 40 miles away. She plans on coming here to hang out soon. Tonight I asked her to send me a wet hair selfie after her shower because \"wet hair selfies make my knees go weak\". Smooth, right? She sent me a selfie where you can tell that she meticulously showed more than she \"had\" to, but covered her nipple with her hair. I called her out in a joking\/teasing way and she all but said that she was teasing me.\n\nShe's a super cool person. Super adventurous type. I asked her if she wanted to see a movie, get dinner, chill at my place or tie a skateboard to the back of my chair and cruise around Walmart and she goes \"Why not all of the above?\" which gave me a raging heart-on. She's a goofball like I am.\n\nNow. Here's where my mental block is. Being funny and smooth is my best moves besides manufactured confidence. Because of my disability, I can't really move much. So I can't really initiate anything in the most traditional ways. I have to use my words. \"Hey wanna fuck?\" or \"let me kiss you\" just doesn't...sound smooth or charming when I imagine it. Am I just too into my own head about it? Or, preferably, can you guys think of any more in character (funny\/witty) ways to ask?\n\nThat's the difficult one. I seem to be doing well at knowing when someone is interested and is\/or flirting. But if you guys have any thoughts on what I should look for in that area too, that would be super appreciated! Even if you feel like it's blatantly obvious, please do share still. Because besides the fake it til you make it part, I sincerely don't have any fucking clue what I'm doing even if it seems like I do. On her Tinder bio she said that she wasn't looking for anything serious, but she also deleted her account too. So even if someone isn't looking for something serious, they have the potential to find it anyway.\n\nProbably another very obvious answer, but I want to make sure from people who are far more experienced than myself. I early on mentioned tapping that ass into orbit, her profile originally said nothing serious, she sent me flirty photos, and she's going to drive 40 miles to hang out with me. Is it pretty safe to assume that she's down to have her ass tapped into orbit? That distance sucks, but I'm also definitely capable of getting to her as well.\n\nAnd just advice in general in this area would be fantastic. How to pick up girls in general. Honestly anything you can think of. Pretend I'm your son and you're teaching me how to ride a bike that I didn't even know existed.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the lengthy post! I've wondered about a lot of this for a LONG time."

    "body":"Me(30F) and my partner(36M) have been together for the better part of the last 7 years and we have a 5 year old son together. \n\nSince the end of September he's been living at his moms an hour away because I couldn't handle him being in our house anymore. He had become so negative, lazy, undependable and started undermining me every chance he got when it came to parenting. I was so sure I was done with the relationship as he seemed unwilling to try to talk and attempt to work through our problems even though he kept saying he didn't want to break up. \n\nWell we got into a big fight in the beginning of this month and he finally opened up to me (which I know is really hard for him to do) and he told me that he's been feeling resentful towards me for a long time. He feels as though once I became a mom, I stopped being his partner. That I put all of myself into our son and our home and I don't leave anything left for him. That our relationship has become me telling him what to do and treating him more like an employee than my partner. \n\nI feel like such an arsehole. Since he told me that, it's all I can see. I was 24 when I got pregnant and once I had our son I knew I had to grow up so I kind of faked it until you make it kind of thing. It's like I hyper focused on being a mom and nothing else and of course having a kid makes it very hard to get any alone time so I must have just let our relationship fade into the background. \n\nI love this man with every part of me and I have since the moment I laid eyes on him and honestly I never intended for things to go this way so\u00a0 I'm looking for any advice on ways I can make him feel like\/show him I care about him and that our relationship is important to me. Or behaviors I should be changing, traditions\/habits I could start so he knows I prioritize him (example could be making his favorite meal every whatever day of the month, so even if that day is a day that I'm exhausted, he knows that I still made it because I love him) \n\nI've only been able to think of things from a womans perspective so I'm hoping some of you can tell me what you would like as a man or what has your SO done to make you feel like a priority. I know what I'm asking may sound confusing but hopefully you can understand it enough Haha \n\nPlease keep in mind that he's a recovering alcoholic so nothing to do with drinking or going out to a bar ect. We've also never hired a babysitter or left our son with family so that we could have time to ourselves but I would be willing to do so if you think it would help."

    "title":"Is it better to go off on fake friends or no? Why or why not?",
    "body":"I am almost 25 and I still struggle with anger issues and trust issues. I had a fallout with some close friends and it made me distrust everyone that was close to me. As a result, I hadn\u2019t had a single relationship last long in the past few years. It makes me think there is something wrong with me as I always used to have friends. \n\nI resorted to friends after college who rarely would hit me up to chill. I\u2019d always have to hit them up. Eventually I got booted from the group due to beef with some members. I got into a tussle with a guy for play and ended up getting hurt. I told him and he just made it seem like I was overreacting.  After that I distrusted the whole group. \n\nI ended up not keeping in touch with the group much recently. I had some close childhood friends in that group, but they\u2019d rather chill with them than me nowadays. As soon as I sensed this, I developed some hate towards my former friends.\n\nNowadays, I get drunk and try and solve issues through text with friends. It has made me create a toxic relationship towards friends. Now I\u2019m willing to call out friends for their fake ness as soon as shit hit the fan. I\u2019m tired of fake friends and I\u2019m aggressively trying to lose them.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is good or not. I can tell when a friend eventually turns into an acquaintance because they\u2019d rather chill with new people and not bother keeping in touch with me. And it\u2019s not always their fault I guess, sometimes they are so busy to reply.\n\nBut it always hits me personally. So I end up drinking a lot one night, and venting my concerned about the relationship to all these friends. But they look at me like I\u2019m crazy and gives them more of a reason to avoid me. For instance, my friend went on a trip this past weekend, they didn\u2019t even mention it to me. They had planned it behind my back and they didn\u2019t even care enough to include me. I don\u2019t even like to call them my friends because I know deep down they don\u2019t care.\n\n The thing is that the one guy who I\u2019m closest with, hits me up when it\u2019s convenient for him. But he doesn\u2019t hit me up otherwise unless I remind him. He even told me he was busy last weekend, he posts on his story chilling with a friend and his gf. But he tells me he couldn\u2019t chill, which just makes me have trust issues. The truth is that I can\u2019t connect with them without weed or beer so it makes me think of I\u2019m truly their friends."

He shows me a bit but we both work long hours and don't see each other much and  he takes gaming quite seriously. We used to sometimes play together but that doesn't happen anymore. I tried to watch the walking dead with him but it upset me too much. I know it's ridiculous and I really enjoyed it when I watched it before but I'm not in the right place mentally for it anymore!

Got a new job, enrolled in 17 hours of classes this semester, expanding my social circles, reconnecting with old friends, breaking shitty old habits, and adopting a slew of good new ones. By any standard, I'm doing great.\n\n\nExcept I can't really get her off my mind. I stay busy. I read, I write, I hang out with people. But in the moments during the page turn, or the clicking of the mechanical pencil, or the lull in conversation during dinner, there she is. She's there after I turn off the light, there in my dreams, and I wake up in a panic wondering where I am and where she is. Literally every damn day.\n\n\nEvery victory of the last two months (and I'm indescribably proud of how many there have been) is punctuated by how proud I think she'd be. I'm trying not to dwell. I'm not dwelling, really. I'm being ambushed, and the weeks since have done nothing to decrease the sense of loss.\n\n\nI know I'm brokenhearted. I've been here before. But it doesn't seem to be getting better. What do?\n\nEDIT: I need to put my head down, stay the course, and do the hard, painful work while everything hurts anyway.\n\nI just have this sense of yet more lost time to go. I want so badly to move on with my life. The last several months of the relationship itself were so goddamn destructive and pointless, I really hate the idea of being held back still in such a fundamental way.\n\nThe past can be such a morass of regret and misery that I try to avoid considering it more than is necessary. I think what I'm so bothered by is that intellectually, I've got this thing figured out. What happened, what to do now, and whenever the time comes, a pretty solid idea of what and what not to do next time around.\n\nThe entire emotional experience is beyond my conscious control. That's cool too. That shit is basic, primitive, built into the hardware itself. Different juices squirt around in my brain and I feel different things before I've had the opportunity to even apply anything cognitive to it.\n\nIts always a choice, and I've been choosing well. The more a habit I make of it, the better position I'll be in and habits I'll have when I finally pull my head out of my ass and stop living so mechanically. Thanks for helping me realize that I'm okay. I'm doing better than well, even if it doesn't feel like it."

I get distracted so easy, lack serious case of moativations unless I'm backed against the wall, and I'm lazy.\n\nI've been living in the city at a sublet for 7 months now. I don't speak to my mom or immediate family because it was a very toxic environment when I was growing up. I've been abandoned, kicked out, and even just packed my shit and dipped. (This all started when I was 16)\n\nNow my backs really against the wall. I picked up a habit of smoking. And tbh I liked it. Weed just helped me. Helped me through alot. But I can't ignore the fact That through and through its been the catalyst for each and every one of my major falls.\n\nFast forward to last night. I had just enough left to roll a small J. I went outside to smoke. (Won't smoke in the house. The lady who I sublet the room from does not like any of that) Came back with the munchies and popped an instant ramen into the microwave. Here's stupid me. I forgot to add water.\n\nAfter 5 minutes I go back to the kitchen only to smell smoke. And it's everywhere. I'm lucky there wasn't a fire tbh. Immediately I open all the windows in the house. Settled the smoke, and then I started to clean everything.\n\nThis was at 3:00am so I left a note detailing what happened and that I accept full responsibility. \n\nI left for work and came back where my sublet tells me that she's sorry but she needs me to move out in a week. I understand tbh.\n\nHere's the kicker. Because of the holidays I was down off work for 2 weeks. So I had to tap into my savings just to pay rent. Now savings is exhausted. \n\nI've got no family lifelines to call and ask for a place to crash. I've been honestly contemplating just ending it. I'm tired. I have no more energy for this.

    "body":"**Background:** 6 ft 165 lbs so unfortunately not a huge guy. I have always been an introvert & shy since I was little. Was a nerd growing up and didn't have many friends. I tend to shy away from confrontations and look for an alternate solution. I also took a personality test that identified me as an INTJ which explains a lot. I've been very successful in my career and that has given me somewhat of a boost in confidence.  I goto the gym and lift weights 4-5 times a week.\n\n**My problem:** I've been getting more and more depressed when I back down from situations where I should be making my voice be heard. When something happens that is bothering me, instead of speaking up I overanalylyze & rationalize my concern instead of telling the person what's on my mind. Then I get home and beat myself up over it.\n\n**Example**\nWas on the patio of a restaurant and these 2 guys were smoking and the wind was blowing the smoke into my face. Instead of telling them hey can you please move further away, I freeze up and rationalized it as well there wasn't a non smoking sign and I was almost done eating anyways to avoid confrontation.\n\nEvery time this happens, I spiral into depression for a day or two. I would like to break out of this cycle and was wondering if anyone has any advice on this matter?"

    "body":"Here's a little about me. When I was 7 or 8 I was sexually abused multiple times by two different family members. As a result, I've never been able to form a serious relationship and have intimacy issues. I've never told anyone about this. Before some of you tell me to seek professional help, I have considered going to see a therapist but I don't have the money or time right now. \n\nAnyways, I'm in my early 20's and finally like who I am and feel good about myself. I've tried online dating and have had an overall okay experience. My problem is that every time I feel like something good could happen, I tend to push people away or shut down. I just don't know when to tell someone I'd like to date about this. I guess I'm afraid of what they'll think of me, or that they won't be interested anymore.

    "body":"Dear Over 40 men,\n   I am a 41 year old man.  Wealthy.  Successful.  Not fat or ugly.  I can get laid fairly easily, but that is not what I want.  I want a healthy relationship with a caring, nurturing, sexual woman.  Looks aren't even a big deal for me.  Just attitude.  My ex was very mentally and at times physically abusive.  She isolated me from my friends (have no friends now) and I have no family.  We met when I was twenty.  She was my third sexual experience (still didn't know what to do really) and my second relationship of any type.  \n\nI met someone online, and I promptly messed that up.  Probably because I am so starved for affection.  I wrote a TIFU about it.  I can't link it, but you can find it in my profile.\n\n\nMy question to you guys is, if I need nurturing and care in order to heal and be able to stop being so emotionally starved, but I scare anyone that is capable or willing to give me this care with my desperate need, how do I get out of this catch 22?\n\nHow do I start to live again?  Or did those twenty years in a bad relationship ruin me for anyone?\n\nPS:  That's probably the most pathetic thing I've ever written, but sadly true."

I've been an avid porn user since I was about 11 years old (29 now) and usually jerk 5 to 7 times a week. I'm happy to have a high sex drive but I'm aware this quick dopamine hit is affecting my ability to interact with women I find attractive to the point I'm embarrassed.\n\nNote: I know porn addiction is a relatively newly studied phenomenon and some of you will say its not a thing. Hey, that's great, I'm really happy some people are able to enjoy the content without being mentally effected. Unfortunately I have addiction issues and I don't work like that.\n\nI've been able to overcome many, many addictions but porn has been the one that I can't seem to. I tried SAA, etc. I tend to always relapse. Counselling is not helping either.\n\nI'm trying to find a medium: I want to reset my dopamine and my brain in a sense - I want to feel confident speaking to attractive women (I already gym, improved my fashion, all the stuff that most people suggest) without doing it for the sole purpose of fantasizing\/hoping to get laid\/being a nervous wreck. but I would ALSO like to be able to release myself. Its been 2 weeks and I'm losing my mind. Unfortunately, I don't think I have that option right now as it very quickly leads to a \"relapse\". Even if I finishing without porn, I end going back to it.\n\nAnybody here have experience with this? Tips? Words of encouragement?"

    "title":"Why can't I find my masculinity?",
    "body":"Hi, I am a 39-year-old man and I feel I am still struggling to connect to my masculinity. Like most men, when I was young I wanted to grow up to become a strong man. However, throughout my life, I haven't really felt this. \n\nMy early life was difficult. My father was an alcoholic and emotionally abusive who left us when I was around 6-7 years old. He is also probably the most masculine man I have ever met (even though it's clear he has his flaws). There was no denying he was the alpha. I still have a relationship with him but only see him a few times a year.\n\nThen, on the other hand, I was raised mostly by my over-protective and fearful mother with my 2 sisters. I had very little male influence in my life growing up. Except for my uncle who came into my life as I was around 9 years old. But he was also toxic and developed an unhealthy relationship with my older sister. He would also have crazy outbursts of anger. So I have aways grown up quite fearful of men and people in general. \n\nWhen I was young I was very shy and quiet but I managed to get through school pretty much unscathed by laying low and in my teenage years by putting on a tough guy persona even though inside I was a scared pussy. I was scared of the dark until I was into my 20's. But I understood that by acting tough most people wouldn't mess with me. When I got into my later teens I would hang around with groups who were destructive and violent and I did some stuff I am not proud of. This was until I was 21 when I messed with the wrong group and it scared me so much I withdrew completely from violence and fighting. \n\nIt was about this time I started to lift weights and started to build myself up. I thought being big and jacked would make me a man. I spent about 10 years lifting and getting big but I still didn't connect to that sense of masculinity I have been seeking my whole life. Most of my life I have been promiscuous with women but have always struggled to attract high-value women. Over the last few years, I have even started to question my sexuality even though I have never found men sexually attractive. This has also caused me a lot of distress.\n\nI do also struggle to connect with other men. I can get along fine with 'beta' males. But anytime I am around a strong alpha male, I just feel fearful and struggle to be myself. I have linked this back to my early life experiences but also because I haven't been able to connect to the masculinity within myself. It's almost as though I am scared of my power and so I feel scared around other men who express their power.\n\nOn a positive note over the last 4-5 months, I have done a lot of good work on myself, I still enjoy working out but its more about the mental benefits for me now. I am quite disciplined in life and do activities that challenge me. So over these last few months, I have noticed a gradual improvement in my life. But I have come to realize that real change is slow. \n\nI do wonder if I will ever feel like a 'man' or if this sense of masculinity is even inherent within me? Or am I searching for something I will never find? Is my nature naturally more soft and feminine? Should I just accept this? Or is it a byproduct of overprotective mothering? \n\nI'm sure I am not the only one in this position. Just wondered if anyone had any advice. (My first time posting btw)\n\nThanks for reading"

I'll be the first to admit perhaps I wasn't the best employee and I struggled with being consistently motivated. I honestly should've left the company a while ago because it was ultimately a dead-end. \n\nI'm starting to realize that maybe I'm too fucked up and my brain can't undo the wiring of who I am.

Before I lied to myself that I didn\u2019t know the cause but deep down I know what it is. All my life I\u2019ve grown up watching these extraordinary men, these heroes, do incredible things both on and off the screen. All my life even though my father was present ive tried to build who I am based of the superman and Spider-Mans and famous celebrities of the world.

To feel like my life is a journey with real weight that actively influences the hearts and minds of other people. I know I\u2019ll never be some super hero or some crazy rich actor but somewhere inside my mind it won\u2019t accept anything less than perfection anything less than a life with real meaning.

Obviously it wasn't forceful given that size difference etc, but it wasn't anything I would have consented to normally due to being in a relationship -- and, as a man, if any girl had been half as gone as I was then, I would never consider doing anything sexual with them. \n\nSince then, my girlfriend has broken up for me for \"cheating\" on her, and the general consensus among friends is either that I am a dick who just got wasted and cheated or that it's awesome that I had sex with an attractive girl. \n\nThis has been sort of a shitty cycle, as personally I'm embarrassed\/ashamed\/uncomfortable about it. Gonna talk to a therapist about it, of course, but I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation.

    "body":"This is a longer story to read. Take it as proof that it is something that deeply troubles me, even though, after reading, some might come to the conclusion that I need not worry at all. The events I describe here happened about *18 years ago*. I can\u2019t exactly pinpoint when it was from memory. It was roughly during the last year at school or the year after leaving highschool (or the equivalent of highschool in my country). Probably the former. I remember to have taken a riddled note of it in my diary at the time, but couldn\u2019t find it in there. **Some exposition first** So, as young adults, me and my circle of friends (all 18-20 years old at the time) used to go to a club that was about a 30 minute drive away from where we lived. We went there almost every weekend, and a lot of times, one of our teachers from school, who we also casually hung out with sometimes on weekends, took us there in his car. If you think that\u2019s weird, I agree, but I did not think much of it back then. And even though it\u2019s not at the center of what I want to get off my chest in this post: behold, more on that later. One of those nights, we were there with four people, I think. Said Teacher, me, a male and a female friend. Not sure about the male friend though, maybe it was just the three of us. As usual, we partied, danced and got drunk. Somethin was different than usual. I recall the interaction with said female friend as being flirtatious that evening. It is noteworthy here that a couple of years before that we had a fling and she also was the first girl I dated and kissed, which is actually another not so cool story on its own. At the time of the events here, however, we were both in a relationship with someone else. I was in a relationship with another girl, who she was best friends with and who also was part of our social circle, yet not present that evening. She was in a relationship with another guy, and on occasion we would all hang out together. I didn\u2019t have a crush on her or anything, but I definitely still found her very attractive, and she certainly was. She often was very flirtatious with men and had a lot of admirers \/ guys chasing her. I\u2019m not saying she was a \u201eslut\u201c or anything. That\u2019s not what I mean here and that\u2019s also not what I thought back then. What I mean is that she seemed to enjoy getting guys excited about her, or at least that is what I and some of my friends, including my girlfriend at the time, thought of her. She knew how to push the right buttons, so to say. At that time, there was also a persistent rumor that she had an affair with the teacher I mentioned, who was three times our age. It is something I never believed back then but found out many years later to be true. **How that evening went** What I know for a fact is, that evening I was getting very excited about her. I do not recall specific details as to why I felt that way, but just consider me a rather insecure 20 yo man, full of hormones and a little too much alcohol. I felt turned on by her. And I think that she was about as drunk as I was. Reflecting on it today, I have to admit it is entirely possible, that that\u2019s what I made myself believe: that she somehow made me feel that way, that she sent signals. Maybe that was what I wanted to believe that night, wishful thinking. I don\u2019t know. When we were on our way back, driving in the car late at night, the following happened. We were all drunk, tired and exhausted. She was in the passenger seat, and I was in the backseat, sitting behind her, while the teacher (sober, of course) was driving the car. I wanted to touch her and since I also was very insecure, I asked her if she would like me to massage her. She said yes, and so I started massaging her on the way home. We usually would not engage in such activities involving physical contact, that\u2019s just not how we were with each other friendship-wise. It was a little step in another direction, and I had no clear goal in mind here, yet I slowly began to touch her in a more sexual way, slowly moving my hands under her shirt a little further, and further, ultimately carressing her breasts. Not in a will-nilly-let\u2019s-go kind of way, but slowly, carefully exploring. Since I wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to feel uncomfortable. This went on for a little while, I think. I was thinking she enjoyed it, even though it was obviously objectively hard to tell under the described circumstances. At some point I stopped and that\u2019s it. Eventually the ride ended. Teacher dropped each of us off individually since we lived a little spread out in the area. I don\u2019t remember who got off first and all that. So that was that. **Initial afterthoughts** I recall being very ashamed the next day. Ashamed, because I felt that with this whole thing I had cheated on my girlfriend that night (and that she had too). And in my mind, I blamed the girl for that (even though the physical thing, touching her, was clearly my own initiative). I felt like shit and swore I would never speak of this, never think about it again, and I think I just completely avoided that girl from that day on. Actually I have no memory about the times following these events. All I can say is that we never spoke about it and that over the years, everyone went different ways,..."
