What can I do at this point?\n\nSo a little about myself. I'm 23(M) and for as Long as I can remember I've always been fucking shit up. I'm just not always there. I get distracted so easy, lack serious case of moativations unless I'm backed against the wall, and I'm lazy.\n\nI've been living in the city at a sublet for 7 months now. I don't speak to my mom or immediate family because it was a very toxic environment when I was growing up. I've been abandoned, kicked out, and even just packed my shit and dipped. (This all started when I was 16)\n\nNow my backs really against the wall. I picked up a habit of smoking. And tbh I liked it. Weed just helped me. Helped me through alot. But I can't ignore the fact That through and through its been the catalyst for each and every one of my major falls.\n\nFast forward to last night. I had just enough left to roll a small J. I went outside to smoke. (Won't smoke in the house. The lady who I sublet the room from does not like any of that) Came back with the munchies and popped an instant ramen into the microwave. Here's stupid me. I forgot to add water.\n\nAfter 5 minutes I go back to the kitchen only to smell smoke. And it's everywhere. I'm lucky there wasn't a fire tbh. Immediately I open all the windows in the house. Settled the smoke, and then I started to clean everything.\n\nThis was at 3:00am so I left a note detailing what happened and that I accept full responsibility. \n\nI left for work and came back where my sublet tells me that she's sorry but she needs me to move out in a week. I understand tbh.\n\nHere's the kicker. Because of the holidays I was down off work for 2 weeks. So I had to tap into my savings just to pay rent. Now savings is exhausted. \n\nI've got no family lifelines to call and ask for a place to crash. I've been honestly contemplating just ending it. I'm tired. I have no more energy for this. Everytime I ask myself if I see myself in 2020 my body just seize up. I'm not crying, I'm not in intense emotional distress. I feel nothing. Honestly trying to see if there's a way for me to off myself, but can't do deal with the thought of putting past family and loved ones through that.\n\nTLDR: Getting kicked out in a week from my sublet. Holidays exhausted my funds. No family to go back to. Trying to rationalize ending it. "

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult place to be, and I want to start by acknowledging the immense weight you are carrying right now. You are facing a perfect storm of crises\u2014eviction, financial collapse, isolation, and deep exhaustion\u2014and it is completely understandable that you feel depleted and that your mind is going to the darkest possible places.\n\n**Before we talk about anything else, I need to address the thoughts you are having about ending your life.**\n\nThe feeling of numbness and exhaustion is often the brain's way of coping with unbearable stress. When you are hit with crisis after crisis, it\u2019s natural to feel like ending the pain is the only way out. **Please know that these feelings are temporary, even if the situation feels permanent.** There are people who want to help you through this immediate crisis.\n\n***\n\n### **Immediate Crisis Support**\n\nIf you are feeling like you might hurt yourself, please reach out to one of these resources right now. They are free, confidential, and available 24/7.\n\n*   **Call or Text 988** (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline)\n*   **Text HOME to 741741** (Crisis Text Line)\n\n***\n\n### **What Do You Do When You Have Nothing Left?**\n\nYou asked what to do when you have nothing left. The answer is: **You stop looking for big solutions and focus only on the smallest, most essential step for the next 24 hours.**\n\nWhen everything is downhill, the only goal is survival. Right now, your primary focus is not fixing your job, your motivation, or your past\u2014it is securing a safe place to sleep next week.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the immediate, urgent steps you can take.\n\n***\n\n## **Action Plan: The Next 7 Days**\n\nYou are being kicked out in a week, and your funds are exhausted. We need to prioritize housing and food.\n\n### **1. Housing (The Most Urgent Need)**\n\nYou cannot solve the underlying issues of motivation or past habits if you don't know where you will be sleeping.\n\n*   **Call 211:** This is a comprehensive social services hotline available in most areas of the US and Canada. They can connect you immediately with local resources for emergency shelter, temporary housing, and rapid rehousing programs for young adults (since you are 23).\n*   **Youth Homeless Services:** Since you are under 25, many cities have specific programs for transitional youth that offer more stability and resources than general shelters. Search online for \"[Your City] Youth Homeless Services\" or ask 211 specifically about these programs.\n*   **Sublet Agreement Check:** While you understand why your sublet is asking you to leave, depending on your city/state, one week might not be legal notice, even in a sublet situation. Look up tenant rights for your locality. This might buy you a few extra days, which are crucial right now.\n*   **Couch Surfing (Non-Family):** Do you have any friends, even acquaintances from work, school, or past jobs, who might let you crash on a couch for a night or two while you secure a shelter spot? Even a few nights can relieve the pressure.\n\n### **2. Financial and Food Resources**\n\nYou need to stretch your remaining cash and ensure you can eat.\n\n*   **Food Banks/Pantries:** Locate the closest food bank. You do not need money to get groceries from a food bank. This frees up any remaining cash for transportation or other needs.\n*   **Apply for Emergency Assistance:** Look into local government assistance programs (like SNAP/food stamps or emergency cash aid). The application process can be overwhelming, but many homelessness support centers can help you fill out the paperwork quickly.\n*   **Talk to Your Employer:** If you have a decent relationship with your supervisor, explain that you are facing a severe housing crisis and ask if there is any possibility of extra hours, advanced pay, or if they are aware of any local employee assistance funds.\n\n### **3. Addressing the Guilt and Self-Perception**\n\nIt sounds like you have internalized a lot of blame for past struggles\u2014the family toxicity, the distraction, the laziness, and now the ramen incident.\n\nPlease try to reframe this: **The ramen incident was an accident, caused by being high, exhausted, and stressed.** It was not a moral failure. It was a mistake that had severe consequences due to your current fragile housing situation.\n\nYou are not \"fucking shit up\" because you are inherently bad; you are struggling because you have been dealing with instability, neglect, and trauma since you were 16, and you are trying to manage these heavy issues alone, without a safety net. That is an enormous burden for a 23-year-old.\n\nYou recognized the weed helped you cope but also caused problems. That is a clear, honest assessment. Right now, we put the focus on coping with the housing crisis, but recognizing that pattern is a huge step toward making different choices once you are stable.\n\n***\n\n### **Moving Forward**\n\nYou asked if I\u2019ve ever been in a situation where it all seemed to be going downhill. While I can\u2019t offer personal experiences, I can tell you that hitting \"rock bottom\" often means you finally stop trying to hold up the facade of stability and can start building something real, even if it\u2019s just one brick at a time. The fact that you cleaned up the smoke, left a note taking responsibility, and are reaching out for help right now shows huge resilience.\n\n**You are tired because you have been fighting alone for years. Let someone else help you fight for the next week.**\n\nWhat city are you in (or general region)? Knowing this might allow me to suggest specific local resources or phone numbers you can call immediately.\n\nCan you commit to calling 211 or the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline right now, just to get the ball rolling on finding emergency shelter?"
