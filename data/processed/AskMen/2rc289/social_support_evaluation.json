This is not the behavior of a healthy, emotionally available partner.\n\n**To summarize what we know:**\n\n*   **Timeline:** Only four months in.\n*   **Behavior:** Explicitly told you he won't talk to you (stonewalling/punishment).\n*   **Trigger:** A football game (trivial issue).\n*   **Age:** Nearly 30 (should know better).\n\nThis suggests that this is his default conflict resolution strategy, and it is a toxic one that will only get worse as the relationship progresses and real disagreements arise.\n\n**What are your thoughts now that you see this behavior so clearly, so early on?**\n\nIf you are looking for advice on how to handle this, here is a suggested approach that prioritizes your self-respect:\n\n1.  **Give him the space he demanded.** Do not contact him. Use this time to think clearly about the relationship without his influence.\n2.  **Decide on your boundary.** When he eventually breaks his silence, you need to be prepared to address the behavior, not the game.

Using withdrawal to hurt me is emotionally damaging, and it is a dealbreaker for me in a relationship. I need to know that you understand this behavior is unacceptable and will not happen again.\"\n\nIf he apologizes sincerely and commits to changing, you can decide if you want to give him a chance (though remember, he showed you his true colors early).\n\nIf he gets defensive, minimizes the behavior (\"I just needed space\"), or blames you (\"You made me so mad I had no choice\"), then you have your answer about the future of this relationship.\n\nHow does the idea of setting that firm boundary feel to you?",
