Shift the Focus Back to Yourself\n\nRight now, you are focused on *his* timeline. It might be helpful to shift the focus to what *you* need.\n\n*   **What is an acceptable waiting period for you?** Is it 24 hours? 48 hours?\n*   **What communication standards do you require in a relationship?** (e.g., \"I need a partner who can communicate respectfully, even when they are upset.\")\n\n### 2. Consider Sending One Final, Clear Message\n\nIf you feel you need to establish a boundary, you could send a single, calm message that addresses the behavior without pleading or chasing him. This puts the responsibility for the relationship back on him and confirms that you won't participate in this behavior.\n\nHere are a couple of examples of what you could say (or choose not to say anything at all, which is also a valid response):\n\n*   \"I understand you are upset about the game, but I cannot accept being given the silent treatment. When you are ready to communicate respectfully, please reach out. I won't be checking in until then.\"\n*   \"While I respect you need space, shutting down all communication is not how I handle conflict or disappointment. I hope we can talk when you are ready to have a constructive conversation.\"\n\n### 3. Take Space for Yourself\n\nRegardless of whether you send a message, please use this time to take care of yourself. Don't sit by the phone waiting. Go do something that brings you joy or distraction.\n\n**How does that feel to read? Do you feel like you would want to send a message, or would you prefer to wait and see what happens?**",

When we are hurt, we often want the person who hurt us to know the impact of their actions.\n\nHowever, when dealing with someone who is actively using the silent treatment, expressing sadness might not lead to the response you are hoping for, and it carries a risk.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **Risk of Reinforcement:** Sometimes, when a person is using stonewalling as a control tactic, hearing that their action made you sad can reinforce the behavior. They might think, \"My tactic worked, she's upset, now I have the upper hand.\"\n*   **The Goal is Accountability, Not Pleading:** While you are sad, the core issue is his unacceptable behavior. It's more effective to focus on the behavior itself rather than just your emotional reaction to it.\n\nIf you decide to reach out, you can absolutely express your feelings, but it's crucial to pair that feeling with a clear boundary about the behavior.\n\n**How about framing it like this, which includes your sadness but holds him accountable for his communication choice:**\n\n> \"I am sad and worried because you have decided to shut down communication completely.

This shows an inability to regulate his emotions and a tendency to displace anger onto his partner.\n2.  **It Was Announced:** He didn't just retreat quietly; he *declared* he wasn't going to talk to you. This is a deliberate, conscious choice to use communication withdrawal as a weapon. This is often called **stonewalling**, and it is one of the \"Four Horsemen\" of relationship failure identified by decades of research by the Gottman Institute, because it completely shuts down connection and problem-solving.\n3.  **It's Open-Ended:** By not giving you a timeline, he is maximizing your anxiety and making you wait for his return, which puts him in a position of power and control.\n\n---\n\n### How to Determine if It's a \"One-Off\"\n\nSince you are uncertain about his character, the way you determine if this is a pattern or a one-off event is by **how he responds when he finally decides to speak to you.**\n\n**What to look for (Signs it might be a one-off/he is capable of change):**\n\n*   **Genuine Apology:** He initiates the contact with a sincere apology that focuses on his behavior, not your reaction. (e.g., \"I am truly sorry I shut you out. That was immature and unfair to you, and I won't do it again.\")\n*   **Acknowledgement of Impact:** He acknowledges how his actions made you feel without getting defensive.\n*   **Willingness to Discuss:** He agrees to talk about better ways to handle his frustration in the future.\n\n**What to watch out for (Signs it's a pattern/a bigger red flag):**\n\n*   **No Apology/Just \"Moving On\":** He acts like nothing happened, hoping you will just follow suit.\n*   **Blame/Defensiveness:** He apologizes weakly (\"Sorry you got upset\") or tries to justify his behavior (\"I was just so angry, you should understand\").\n*   **Shifting the Blame:** He tries to make it your fault (\"If you hadn't brought up the game, I wouldn't have been so upset\").\n\n**In short: Yes, this behavior is a serious red flag. Your concern is absolutely warranted. Your next step is to observe his reaction when he breaks the silence to see if he treats this event with the seriousness it deserves.**",

If a football loss triggers a multi-day shutdown now, imagine what happens when you face real stress: a job loss, a serious illness, or the exhaustion of raising children.\n2.  **The Escalation of Tactics:** When stonewalling becomes a pattern, it often escalates. The duration of the silence might increase, or it might be coupled with other controlling behaviors.\n3.  **The Loss of Safety:** In a healthy marriage, you need to feel safe and secure, knowing your partner will turn toward you during tough times. This behavior teaches you the opposite: that he will turn *away* from you when he is personally uncomfortable, leaving you isolated.\n\nWhat you are experiencing right now is a **gift of information.** You are seeing a potential future, and you have the power to decide if that is the future you want to commit to.\n\n### Turning the Realization into Action\n\nSince you are not married, you have the ability to draw a very firm line right now.\n\nWhen he finally decides to speak to you, you do not have to just \"move on.\" You need to address the behavior directly, using your realization as the core of your boundary.\n\n**The essential conversation you need to have is not about the football game, but about the future of your relationship.**\n\n**What does this realization\u2014that this could be your weekly reality if you commit further\u2014tell you about the importance of setting a non-negotiable boundary right now?**",

He is showing you his conflict style when he has the least amount of security in the relationship.\n2.  **Testing Boundaries:** He might be unconsciously testing how much you will tolerate. If you allow him to shut down communication now without consequence, he learns that this tactic is effective for getting space and avoiding accountability.\n3.  **Maximum Leverage:** Since you aren't official, you have maximum freedom and minimum entanglement. You have no shared history, no legal ties, and perhaps fewer mutual connections to worry about. This is the easiest time to decide that this behavior is a dealbreaker.\n\n**The question changes from, \"Is this relationship worth saving?\" to \"Is this person demonstrating the qualities I need in a partner?\"**\n\nIf he is this emotionally immature and controlling during the early, light-hearted stages of dating, he is not ready for a healthy relationship.\n\n**Given that you are not official, what does your gut tell you about the future of this relationship if this is the standard of communication he is setting now?**",

When you have an \"enemies-to-lovers\" dynamic, you expect some playful pouting, maybe a dramatic sigh, and a few hours of mock-anger before he smiles and tells you he loves you anyway.\n\nThe problem is, the second that playful banter turns into **days of silence, withdrawal, and emotional punishment**, it stops being a game.\n\n### The Line Between Playful and Punitive\n\n*   **Playful banter** is reciprocal, short-term, and ends with affection. (Example: \"I hate you, you winner. Now come here and give me a hug.\")\n*   **Emotional stonewalling** is one-sided, designed to punish, and forces the recipient (you) to initiate the repair and apologize for the punisher's feelings.\n\nHe didn't make a joke. He took his disappointment and turned it into a weapon to control your emotional state. He is making you anxious and worried, which is exactly what he wants\u2014for your focus to be on his feelings, not your own happiness.\n\nYou are four months in. He has already shown you that his method of conflict resolution is emotional withdrawal and punishment.\n\n**This is not a man who is \"sleeping with the enemy.\" This is a man who is holding his partner emotionally hostage over a game.**\n\nYou don't need to try to fix this. You need to recognize that you have successfully completed the interview phase and decided he is not the right candidate.\n\nWhat would ending this look like for you? Do you want to send one final text stating you're ending things, or do you feel comfortable simply blocking and moving on?",
