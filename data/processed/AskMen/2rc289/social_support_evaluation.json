I need a partner who can handle disappointment without shutting me out. I hope you'll reach out when you're ready to talk maturely, but please know that this silence is unacceptable to me.\"\n\n**Pros:**\n*   You are being honest about your needs and feelings.\n*   You are setting a healthy boundary immediately.\n*   You give him an opportunity to apologize and step up (or show you he can't).\n\n**Cons:**\n*   He might react defensively or ignore you entirely, reinforcing the silent treatment.\n*   It requires you to be the one to initiate the serious conversation.\n\n***\n\n### Option 2: Wait for Him to Reach Out (Observing His Behavior)\n\nThis approach involves stepping back completely and letting him decide when to break the silence.\n\n*   **When to use it:** If you want to see how long he is willing to punish you, and if you want to observe if he takes responsibility for his actions (or if he just acts like nothing happened).\n*   **How it looks:** You focus on your own life, enjoy your team's victory, and wait. If he texts, you address the silence *then*.\n\n**Pros:**\n*   You are protecting your own peace and not chasing him.\n*   You learn exactly how long he is willing to punish you (which is valuable information).\n*   He is forced to be the one to initiate the repair.\n\n**Cons:**\n*   The waiting can be stressful and anxiety-inducing.\n*   He might take a very long time, prolonging your distress.\n\n***\n\n### Recommendation\n\nGiven that you are worried this is a major red flag for a potential long-term relationship, **I recommend a modified version of Option 1.**\n\n**Send a message that is short, clear, and focuses on the unacceptable nature of the *silence*, not the football loss.**\n\nThis provides him with one final chance to demonstrate maturity. If he responds with an apology, you can proceed cautiously.

That specific detail\u2014that **he explicitly told you he won't talk to you**\u2014changes the dynamic significantly.\n\nThis is no longer just a passive silent treatment or a temporary sulk; this is an **active choice to isolate and punish you** based on an external event, and he is confirming that choice.\n\n### Why This Behavior is Severe\n\n1.  **Intentional Punishment:** By explicitly stating he won't talk to you and then following through, he is intentionally using emotional withdrawal as a form of punishment. This is manipulative and controlling.\n2.  **Lack of Respect:** He is choosing a petty grievance (a football game) over the basic respect and emotional needs of his partner.\n3.  **No Room for Repair:** When someone actively refuses communication, they completely block any possibility of resolution, connection, or comfort.\n\nYou are right to feel like he has taken this to a \"new level.\" This is serious.\n\n### What to Do Next\n\nGiven that he has explicitly stated his intention to shut you out, waiting for him might be allowing him to dictate the terms of your relationship\u2014that he gets to control when communication starts and stops.\n\nThis situation calls for a clear, firm response that sets a boundary around what you will accept in a relationship.\n\nI would strongly recommend sending a short, decisive message (similar to Option 1, but firmer) that addresses the *relationship health*, not the game.\n\n**A suggested approach:**\n\n> \"I understand you are disappointed, but intentionally refusing to talk to me is unacceptable behavior. Partners communicate, especially when they are upset. I cannot be in a relationship where I am punished with silence over a football game. When you are ready to talk to me respectfully about this, let me know. Until then, I need space.\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n*   **It takes the power back:** You are defining the behavior as \"unacceptable\" and setting the terms for when communication will resume (when he is ready to be respectful).\n*   **It focuses on the core issue:** It clearly identifies the problem as his *behavior* (punishment/silence), not the game.\n*   **It protects your peace:** You are giving yourself permission to step back and stop waiting anxiously for him to decide your fate.\n\nHow does it feel to consider setting that firm boundary with him?",

The fact that this is happening **four months into dating, before exclusivity, and long-distance** significantly increases the severity of this red flag.\n\n### Analysis with New Context\n\n| Factor | Implication |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Early Stage (4 Months)** | This is the \"honeymoon phase,\" where people are typically on their best behavior, showing their strengths, and trying to impress their potential partner. If this is his **best behavior**, his average behavior will be worse. |\n| **Long Distance** | Communication is the absolute backbone of a long-distance relationship (LDR). If he is willing to shut down essential communication over a football game now, the LDR will be impossible to sustain during real disagreements or stress. |\n| **Explicit Refusal to Talk** | He is showing you exactly how he handles conflict, stress, and disappointment\u2014by shutting down, punishing, and avoiding responsibility. This is a massive flaw, not a minor quirk. |\n\n**The Verdict:** You are not just seeing a red flag; you are seeing a flashing neon sign that reads: **\"I lack the emotional maturity and communication skills necessary for a healthy adult relationship, especially a long-distance one.\"**\n\n### What to Do Now (The Strategic Approach)\n\nSince you are not exclusive, you have the full freedom to evaluate whether this flaw is compatible with your needs.\n\nYou have two main options, and both involve protecting yourself:\n\n#### Option A: The Final Test (Recommended)\n\nUse the firm boundary message we discussed (or a version of it) to see if he can immediately course-correct and apologize.\n\n**Goal:** To test his ability to take accountability and show respect.\n\n> \"I need to be clear about something. I respect your disappointment, but intentionally refusing to talk to me is a serious breach of trust and communication. This behavior is unacceptable to me. I need a partner who can communicate respectfully, even when upset. If you are not ready to apologize for shutting me out and discuss this maturely, I need to reconsider moving forward with us.\"\n\n**If he responds with:**\n*   **An immediate, sincere apology:** Proceed with extreme caution, but at least he showed he *can* take responsibility.\n*   **Blame, deflection, or continued silence:** You have your answer, and you should consider ending things, as this pattern will only worsen.\n\n#### Option B: Step Back and Re-Evaluate\n\nGiven that this is an LDR and you are only four months in, you could choose to simply step back and decide if you want to invest any more time in someone who treats you this way this early.\n\n**Goal:** To prioritize your peace and decide if he's worth the energy.\n\n**Action:** Do not text him. Do not worry about him. Focus on your life. If and when he texts you, treat him coolly and bring up the silence. If he doesn't bring it up, you can say: *\"I noticed you intentionally shut me out for [X time period] over the game. That is not how I handle communication, and it's a non-negotiable for me in a relationship. I need to think about whether we are compatible.\"*\n\n***\n\n**Key Takeaway:** The \"fragile getting to know each other's flaws\" stage is designed to *protect you* from investing too much in a person who is not a good fit. He is showing you his most significant flaw right now, and it\u2019s a flaw that is fatal to LDRs and healthy communication. Don't minimize it.",
