We are in the beginning stages of dating; ~4 months in. Haven't officially discussed exclusivity, but for the sake of discussion and simplicity let's say we are steadily approaching that level. However... still in that fragile getting to know each other's strengths and flaws stage. This is also long distance; that could be an important fact.\n\n\nDetails of my questions:\n\nOur teams are HUGE rivals. Whenever they play each other we both talk shit; it's a lot of fun, and we love to talk about how \"taboo\" we are. Anyway, his team lost to mine last night, AT their home field, in the playoffs. I did NOT rub it in because as much as I love football, he cares way more than I do. In fact, I didn't text a single thing to him during or post game. I respect him enough to not be a douche bag about it. \n\n\nHowever now he won't talk to me. He literally told me he won't, and he is following through. At first I considered it a continuation of our running \"sleeping with the enemy\" joke, but he's taken it to a new level with punishing me for a football game... I feel ridiculous even verbalizing that this is an issue, but should I consider it a red flag in his behavior? I have no idea when he will text/call me again. He's effectively ruined my enjoyment of my teams victory by acting like a sore, salty-ass loser and I'm afraid that if I were to eventually be in a relationship with this person, this pouty behavior would be too common and cause problems. Do I tell him now that he is making me feel sad that now I can't even talk to the one person I want to? Or do I wait for him to finish licking his wounds?\n\n\nOn the other hand, am I thinking too much about it? I am prone to that, which is why I bring this question to the collective here. Thanks if you read this, I appreciate any feedback. "

      "content": "This is a tough spot, and it\u2019s completely understandable why you\u2019re feeling confused and disappointed. You are definitely not overthinking this\u2014your feelings are valid, and this is exactly the kind of situation that reveals important things about a potential partner early on.\n\nLet's break down your situation and look at this behavior through a few lenses.\n\n---\n\n## Is this a Red Flag?\n\n**Short answer:** Yes, it absolutely has the potential to be a red flag, depending on how he handles the next 24-48 hours.\n\nHere\u2019s why his behavior is concerning, especially in a new relationship:\n\n### 1. The Use of Silence as Punishment\n\nThe most significant issue here is not the football loss itself, but his reaction: **he explicitly told you he won't talk to you and is following through.**\n\n*   **Emotional Maturity:** In a healthy adult relationship, communication doesn't shut down because of external stress, especially something low-stakes like a sports loss. A mature partner might say, \"I'm gutted, I need an hour to myself,\" but they don't impose a silent treatment that punishes the other person.\n*   **The Silent Treatment:** The silent treatment is often considered a passive-aggressive form of control or emotional manipulation. It forces the recipient (you) to feel distress and anxiety, and it puts the burden on you to either wait him out or apologize for something you didn't do.\n\n### 2. Lack of Proportion\n\nYou mentioned he cares more about football than you do, but his reaction is completely disproportionate to the event.\n\n*   **Ruining Your Joy:** He is actively ruining your enjoyment of your team's victory. A partner should be able to separate their disappointment from supporting your happiness. If he can't handle a sports loss without shutting down communication with you, how will he handle actual life stress (job loss, family issues, major disagreements)?\n\n### 3. Communication in Long Distance\n\nYou noted that this is a long-distance relationship (LDR). Communication is the absolute bedrock of an LDR. When a partner intentionally cuts off communication over something trivial, it undermines the trust and stability required for the distance to work. It shows he is willing to sacrifice essential connection for temporary emotional sulking.\n\n---\n\n## What Does This Reveal About Him?\n\nThis behavior suggests a few things that you need to be aware of as you approach exclusivity:\n\n1.  **Poor Conflict Management:** He defaults to avoidance and withdrawal rather than processing disappointment or frustration in a healthy way.\n2.  **Self-Centeredness (in the moment):** He is prioritizing his temporary, intense feelings of disappointment over your shared connection and your feelings of anxiety and sadness.\n3.  **Potential for Pouty Behavior:** Your fear that this \"pouty behavior\" would be common is likely accurate. People often show you their worst communication habits early on. If this is how he handles losing a game, expect similar reactions to disagreements, unmet expectations, or stressful situations.\n\n---\n\n## How Should You Handle This?\n\nYou have two main options, but the key is to prioritize your boundaries and communicate how his behavior affects you, rather than focusing on the football game.\n\n### Option 1: Wait Him Out (The Cautious Approach)\n\nIf you decide to wait, do not wait indefinitely. Give him a specific window (e.g., 24-36 hours from the game end).\n\n**Pros:** It allows him to cool off without engaging in an emotionally charged discussion.\n**Cons:** It reinforces that this behavior works to get space, and it doesn't solve the underlying communication issue.\n\n**If you wait and he texts you:** When he finally reaches out, do not immediately jump back to normal. Acknowledge the issue calmly.\n\n> **You might say:** \"I\u2019m glad to hear from you. I was disappointed that you felt the need to shut down communication for this long. While I understand you were upset about the game, that kind of silent treatment makes me feel anxious and sad, and it\u2019s not how I want us to handle disappointment moving forward.\"\n\n### Option 2: Address the Behavior Directly (The Boundary-Setting Approach)\n\nThis is the approach I recommend, as it establishes a crucial boundary now, while you're still early in the dating process. Send a single, non-escalating text that focuses on the **behavior**, not the game.\n\n**The Goal:** Show him that you won't participate in a silent treatment and that his behavior has consequences on your connection.\n\n> **A suggested text:** \"I understand you\u2019re upset about the game, but intentionally shutting down communication for this long is making me feel sad and anxious. I respect your need for space, but I need a partner who can handle disappointment without resorting to the silent treatment. When you\u2019re ready to talk about the game *and* how we communicate when we\u2019re stressed, please reach out.\"\n\n**Why this works:**\n\n1.  **It\u2019s firm but kind:** You acknowledge his feelings about the game while setting a clear boundary about communication.\n2.  **It frames the issue correctly:** The issue isn't the rivalry; it's the *silent treatment*.\n3.  **It puts the ball back in his court:** You have communicated your feelings, and now the responsibility is on him to respond maturely.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion and Next Steps\n\n**Do not tell him you are sad so he will talk to you.** That risks sounding like you are begging for attention, which rewards his bad behavior. You want him to realize the **behavior** is the problem, not that he needs to fix your sadness.\n\nIf he responds to your boundary-setting text with:\n\n*   **A sincere apology and explanation:** This is a good sign. He shows self-awareness and prioritizes the relationship.\n*   **Defensiveness, minimizing, or more silence:** This is a major red flag. If he can't apologize for making you feel anxious over something this minor, he is showing you exactly what life will be like when actual conflicts arise.\n\nYou are right to be concerned. This is a vital data point about his character and emotional regulation skills. In the delicate \"getting to know each other\" phase, you need to observe his flaws carefully. This reaction is a significant flaw that needs to be addressed before moving forward."
