      "original_text": "Context on our situation:\n\nWe are in our late 20s. We are in the beginning stages of dating; ~4 months in. Haven't officially discussed exclusivity, but for the sake of discussion and simplicity let's say we are steadily approaching that level. However... still in that fragile getting to know each other's strengths and flaws stage. This is also long distance; that could be an important fact.\n\n\nDetails of my questions:\n\nOur teams are HUGE rivals. Whenever they play each other we both talk shit; it's a lot of fun, and we love to talk about how \"taboo\" we are. Anyway, his team lost to mine last night, AT their home field, in the playoffs. I did NOT rub it in because as much as I love football, he cares way more than I do. In fact, I didn't text a single thing to him during or post game. I respect him enough to not be a douche bag about it. \n\n\nHowever now he won't talk to me. He literally told me he won't, and he is following through. At first I considered it a continuation of our running \"sleeping with the enemy\" joke, but he's taken it to a new level with punishing me for a football game... I feel ridiculous even verbalizing that this is an issue, but should I consider it a red flag in his behavior? I have no idea when he will text/call me again. He's effectively ruined my enjoyment of my teams victory by acting like a sore, salty-ass loser and I'm afraid that if I were to eventually be in a relationship with this person, this pouty behavior would be too common and cause problems. Do I tell him now that he is making me feel sad that now I can't even talk to the one person I want to? Or do I wait for him to finish licking his wounds?\n\n\nOn the other hand, am I thinking too much about it? I am prone to that, which is why I bring this question to the collective here. Thanks if you read this, I appreciate any feedback. ",
