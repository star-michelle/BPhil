I think of things that happened to me and I get mad all over again and I find that I start thinking violently and fantasizing about hurting those who wronged me.\n\nI have an aunt who abused me pretty badly as a child. I think about it often and I get mad at my parents and at everyone for letting it happen. \n\nI had to go to counselling as a kid and as a teenager because I had explosive anger issues. I\u2019ve been legitimately trying to get better for years but I feel like nothing is working and I\u2019m always headed to some nervous breakdown. \n\nI just want to find peace"

      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing such deeply personal and painful feelings. I want to acknowledge how incredibly difficult it must be to carry this level of anger and distress about your past experiences, especially the abuse you suffered.\n\nIt takes immense courage to recognize that you are struggling and to keep searching for ways to find peace, even when it feels like nothing is working. Please know that what you are describing\u2014being stuck in the past, feeling intense anger, and having violent intrusive thoughts\u2014is a very common response to trauma, especially childhood abuse. It sounds like you are experiencing significant emotional pain, and you are exhausted from fighting it.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are angry at your aunt for the abuse, and at your parents and others for not protecting you. That anger is a valid, natural reaction to betrayal and harm.\n\nYou mentioned that you've been in counseling as a kid and teenager, and have been \"legitimately trying to get better for years.\" It sounds like you have put in a lot of effort already.\n\nSince you are feeling like you are headed toward a nervous breakdown and are experiencing these intense, violent thoughts, **my most important suggestion is to ensure you have professional support right now.**\n\n### Immediate Suggestions for Support\n\n1.  **Re-engage with Professional Therapy:** Given the intensity of your current feelings, it sounds like you need a safe, structured environment to process this trauma and anger.\n\n    *   **Have you considered going back to therapy recently?** If so, what kind of therapy have you tried in the past (e.g., talk therapy, CBT)?\n    *   **Trauma-Informed Care:** For dealing with past abuse and the resulting anger, highly effective approaches include:\n        *   **EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing):** This is specifically designed to help the brain process traumatic memories so they don't trigger such intense emotional reactions (like anger) anymore.\n        *   **Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT):** Helps you understand and change how you think about your trauma and manage the resulting emotions.\n        *   **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):** Excellent for managing intense emotions, reducing explosive reactions, and learning distress tolerance skills.\n\n2.  **Crisis Support (If needed):** If the violent thoughts become overwhelming or you feel you might act on them, or if you feel you are approaching a breakdown, please reach out to immediate support:\n    *   **Call or text 988** (in the US and Canada) to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. They can talk you through intense moments.\n    *   **Go to your nearest Emergency Room or crisis center.**\n\n### Working Towards Peace: Addressing the Anger\n\nWhile professional help is essential, here are a few concepts and strategies that often help people who are struggling with anger rooted in past trauma:\n\n#### 1. Understanding the Role of Anger\n\nYour anger is serving a purpose, even if it's destructive right now. Often, chronic anger related to trauma is a way the mind tries to:\n\n*   **Protect you:** \"If I stay angry, I stay vigilant, and no one can hurt me again.\"\n*   **Seek Justice:** Because true justice for childhood abuse is often impossible, the anger keeps fighting the battle internally.\n*   **Keep the Memory Alive:** To avoid minimizing what happened to you.\n\nThe goal isn't to eliminate the anger entirely, but to **transform it** from a destructive force that keeps you stuck in the past into a protective, motivating force for your future.\n\n#### 2. Separating the Past from the Present\n\nYou said you feel \"stuck in the past.\" When you think about the abuse, your body and mind react as if it is happening *right now*. This is a hallmark of unprocessed trauma.\n\n*   **Practice Grounding:** When the anger flares up and you start fantasizing violently, try to ground yourself in the present moment.\n    *   **The 5-4-3-2-1 Technique:** Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. This pulls your brain out of the memory loop and into the physical reality of the present, where you are safe.\n\n#### 3. Finding a New Outlet for the Energy\n\nAnger is pure, powerful energy. Since you cannot use it to hurt those who harmed you (and doing so would only harm you further), you need to redirect that massive energy.\n\n*   **Physical Release:** Intense physical activity can be a powerful antidote to explosive anger. This doesn't mean hitting things, but engaging in activities that require effort and focus:\n    *   Running, weightlifting, martial arts (like boxing or Muay Thai, focusing on technique, not aggression), or intense cycling.\n*   **Creative/Constructive Release:** Channel the fighting energy into something productive:\n    *   Art (painting, sculpting)\n    *   Writing (journaling out the violent thoughts instead of holding them in)\n    *   Advocacy (working to support child safety or other causes you care about).\n\nYou are looking for peace, and you deserve it. This journey is incredibly difficult, but it is absolutely possible to process the past and achieve a state where those memories no longer hold you captive.\n\n**What is your immediate feeling about re-engaging with therapy, specifically focusing on trauma-informed approaches like EMDR or DBT?**"
