It's starting to scare me. I went from jerkin it twice a day to no sex drive what so ever. I don't have anyone to ask about it and if I did I sure as shit wouldn't tell them about it. It's kinda scary going from high sex drive to none."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly stressful and worrying, and I want to acknowledge how difficult it must be to go through this, especially feeling like you have no one to talk to about it. It\u2019s a very common human experience, and I\u2019m here to listen and provide information.\n\nYou're asking about **stress-induced erectile dysfunction (ED)**, and you are also describing a sudden, sharp drop in your libido (sex drive).\n\nHere is some information regarding how common this is:\n\n### How Common is Stress ED?\n\n**It is extremely common.**\n\nWhen we talk about ED, it's often categorized as either physical (caused by underlying health conditions like diabetes or heart disease) or psychological (caused by mental states like anxiety, depression, or stress).\n\n*   **Psychological factors (including stress and anxiety) are the primary cause of ED in up to 10-20% of all ED cases.**\n*   **However, psychological factors often *contribute* to nearly all ED cases.** Even when there is a physical cause, the stress and anxiety of \"will I be able to perform?\" often make the problem much worse.\n*   **In younger men, psychological ED (including stress and performance anxiety) is the most common cause of erectile difficulties.**\n\nThe type of situation you are describing\u2014a sudden onset coinciding with a period of intense stress and anxiety\u2014is a classic presentation of psychological ED.\n\n---\n\n### What is Happening When You're Stressed?\n\nWhen you are under immense stress (especially a sudden \"pinnacle\" of it, as you described), your body enters a **\"fight or flight\"** response.\n\n1.  **Hormones:** Stress floods your body with hormones like cortisol and adrenaline.\n2.  **Blood Flow:** These hormones divert blood flow away from non-essential functions (like digestion and sexual arousal) and towards your major muscle groups, preparing you to flee danger.\n3.  **The Result:** Getting an erection requires the parasympathetic nervous system (the \"rest and digest\" system) to be active. When you are highly stressed, the sympathetic nervous system (the \"fight or flight\" system) completely overrides it, making it physiologically very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve or maintain an erection.\n\nFurthermore, the **sudden drop in your sex drive (libido)** is also very typical. High, chronic stress and elevated cortisol levels often suppress testosterone production, and the sheer mental exhaustion of stress leaves little room for sexual thoughts or desire.\n\n### What You Should Do Next\n\nIt's understandable that you are scared, especially since this is a new and rapid change for you.\n\n1.  **Acknowledge the Stress:** Recognize that your body is reacting normally to an abnormal amount of psychological pressure. The fact that you went from a high sex drive to none strongly suggests a psychological/stress-related cause.\n2.  **Give Yourself a Break:** The worst thing you can do right now is pressure yourself to \"fix\" the problem immediately. This just creates performance anxiety, which is ED's best friend. Try to take sex, masturbation, and erections completely off the table for a few days while you focus on stress reduction.\n3.  **Consult a Professional:** While stress is the likely culprit, it is always a good idea to rule out any potential physical causes, especially with such a sudden change.\n\n**My recommendation is to schedule a check-up with a doctor or urologist.**\n\nThey can:\n*   Run basic blood tests (checking testosterone, blood sugar, and cholesterol) to ensure there are no physical factors contributing.\n*   Reassure you that what you are experiencing is likely temporary and stress-related.\n*   Discuss options for managing the immediate anxiety, if necessary.\n\nPlease remember: **What you are going through is temporary and treatable.** The first step is usually addressing the underlying stress and anxiety.\n\nDo you have any questions about the role of stress hormones, or would you like to discuss strategies for managing the stress you mentioned?"
