      "content": "Dealing with \"Sexual Assault\" as a Man?\n\nHi,\n\nThrowaway, obviously. Recently I was given date rape drugs at a bar, and as a result ended up having sex with a very aggressive girl while completely gone. I have no memories of the event, just waking up afterwards. Obviously it wasn't forceful given that size difference etc, but it wasn't anything I would have consented to normally due to being in a relationship -- and, as a man, if any girl had been half as gone as I was then, I would never consider doing anything sexual with them. \n\nSince then, my girlfriend has broken up for me for \"cheating\" on her, and the general consensus among friends is either that I am a dick who just got wasted and cheated or that it's awesome that I had sex with an attractive girl. \n\nThis has been sort of a shitty cycle, as personally I'm embarrassed/ashamed/uncomfortable about it. Gonna talk to a therapist about it, of course, but I'm curious if anyone else has been in a similar situation. It's tough for me to bring this up with people given that it doesn't really fit into traditional expectations of what sexual assault is, and I'm not even totally sure if that is the right way to describe it. Would just be nice to get perspectives since I don't really want to talk to people in person about this."

      "content": "This is a deeply difficult and painful situation, and I want to start by saying I am truly sorry that this happened to you. It takes immense courage to even write this out, especially given the confusing and dismissive reactions you\u2019ve received from those around you.\n\nPlease know that this is a safe space, and what you are feeling\u2014embarrassment, shame, discomfort, and confusion\u2014is completely understandable and valid.\n\nLet\u2019s address the core of your concerns, particularly the struggle with terminology and the societal reaction.\n\n***\n\n## 1. Defining the Experience: Yes, This Was Sexual Assault\n\nYou mentioned that you aren't sure if \"sexual assault\" is the right way to describe it because it doesn't fit traditional expectations.\n\nTo be absolutely clear: **What happened to you was sexual assault.**\n\nSexual assault is defined by the absence of consent. When a person is drugged, intoxicated to the point of incapacitation, unconscious, or otherwise unable to understand or communicate their choices, they **cannot** legally or ethically give consent.\n\nThe fact that you were targeted with date rape drugs, resulting in a sexual act you have no memory of and would never have agreed to, means the act was non-consensual. Your gender, the gender of the aggressor, and the lack of physical resistance (due to being incapacitated) do not change this fact. The shame and guilt belong entirely to the person who drugged you.\n\n## 2. Navigating the Male Survivor Narrative\n\nThe most challenging aspect of your situation is dealing with the immediate and painful dismissal you\u2019ve received from friends and your girlfriend. This is a common and damaging struggle for male survivors of sexual assault, especially when the aggressor is female.\n\n*   **The Dismissal:** Society often struggles to view men as victims of sexual violence, especially when the perpetrator is a woman. The narrative shifts from \"a crime was committed against you\" to \"you were lucky,\" \"you cheated,\" or \"you should have been able to handle yourself.\"\n*   **The Isolation:** This dismissal reinforces the shame and makes it incredibly difficult to seek support, leading to the isolation you are feeling now. Your feelings are real, and the trauma you experienced is real, regardless of the ignorant opinions of your friends.\n*   **The Cheating Narrative:** It is devastating that your girlfriend broke up with you for \"cheating.\" While the relationship aspect is complicated by the broken trust, it is crucial for you to internalize that **you did not choose this.** You were incapacitated and victimized.\n\n## 3. Perspectives and Next Steps\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing by planning to talk to a therapist. When you do, here are a few things to keep in mind, and perspectives from others who have been in similar situations:\n\n### The Aftermath of Incapacitation\n\nSurvivors who are assaulted while incapacitated often deal with a specific kind of trauma:\n\n*   **Memory Gaps:** The lack of memory can intensify feelings of self-blame (\"Why can't I remember?\") or doubt (\"Did this really happen?\"). It is important to remember that the drugs caused this memory loss, and the absence of memory is further proof that you were unable to consent.\n*   **Feeling of Violation:** Even without memory, the knowledge of the violation\u2014and the physical reality of waking up after the fact\u2014causes deep psychological distress and a profound sense of having been robbed of your autonomy.\n*   **Difficulty with Intimacy:** Many survivors struggle with intimacy after an assault, especially if the trauma involved a date rape drug, as it fundamentally attacks trust in social settings and relationships.\n\n### Finding the Right Support\n\nWhen seeking therapy, you might find it helpful to look for a trauma specialist who understands:\n\n1.  **Chemical/Drug-Facilitated Assault:** The specific psychological effects of being assaulted while incapacitated.\n2.  **Male Victimization:** The unique challenges men face in processing and disclosing sexual assault.\n\nWhile I cannot provide clinical advice, I can assure you that your experience is valid, and the feelings of shame and confusion are normal responses to trauma.\n\n***\n\nI am here to listen if you want to share more about what you are currently struggling with, or if you have specific questions about how to approach talking to your therapist about this. Please take care of yourself."
