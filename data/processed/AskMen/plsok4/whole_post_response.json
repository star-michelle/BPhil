Read my story, tell me what you think of it, what you think I should do about it today and how I should handle the troubling feeling of guilt.\n\nThis is a longer story to read. Take it as proof that it is something that deeply troubles me, even though, after reading, some might come to the conclusion that I need not worry at all. The events I describe here happened about *18 years ago*. I can\u2019t exactly pinpoint when it was from memory. It was roughly during the last year at school or the year after leaving highschool (or the equivalent of highschool in my country). Probably the former. I remember to have taken a riddled note of it in my diary at the time, but couldn\u2019t find it in there. **Some exposition first** So, as young adults, me and my circle of friends (all 18-20 years old at the time) used to go to a club that was about a 30 minute drive away from where we lived. We went there almost every weekend, and a lot of times, one of our teachers from school, who we also casually hung out with sometimes on weekends, took us there in his car. If you think that\u2019s weird, I agree, but I did not think much of it back then. And even though it\u2019s not at the center of what I want to get off my chest in this post: behold, more on that later. One of those nights, we were there with four people, I think. Said Teacher, me, a male and a female friend. Not sure about the male friend though, maybe it was just the three of us. As usual, we partied, danced and got drunk. Somethin was different than usual. I recall the interaction with said female friend as being flirtatious that evening. It is noteworthy here that a couple of years before that we had a fling and she also was the first girl I dated and kissed, which is actually another not so cool story on its own. At the time of the events here, however, we were both in a relationship with someone else. I was in a relationship with another girl, who she was best friends with and who also was part of our social circle, yet not present that evening. She was in a relationship with another guy, and on occasion we would all hang out together. I didn\u2019t have a crush on her or anything, but I definitely still found her very attractive, and she certainly was. She often was very flirtatious with men and had a lot of admirers / guys chasing her. I\u2019m not saying she was a \u201eslut\u201c or anything. That\u2019s not what I mean here and that\u2019s also not what I thought back then. What I mean is that she seemed to enjoy getting guys excited about her, or at least that is what I and some of my friends, including my girlfriend at the time, thought of her. She knew how to push the right buttons, so to say. At that time, there was also a persistent rumor that she had an affair with the teacher I mentioned, who was three times our age. It is something I never believed back then but found out many years later to be true. **How that evening went** What I know for a fact is, that evening I was getting very excited about her. I do not recall specific details as to why I felt that way, but just consider me a rather insecure 20 yo man, full of hormones and a little too much alcohol. I felt turned on by her. And I think that she was about as drunk as I was. Reflecting on it today, I have to admit it is entirely possible, that that\u2019s what I made myself believe: that she somehow made me feel that way, that she sent signals. Maybe that was what I wanted to believe that night, wishful thinking. I don\u2019t know. When we were on our way back, driving in the car late at night, the following happened. We were all drunk, tired and exhausted. She was in the passenger seat, and I was in the backseat, sitting behind her, while the teacher (sober, of course) was driving the car. I wanted to touch her and since I also was very insecure, I asked her if she would like me to massage her. She said yes, and so I started massaging her on the way home. We usually would not engage in such activities involving physical contact, that\u2019s just not how we were with each other friendship-wise. It was a little step in another direction, and I had no clear goal in mind here, yet I slowly began to touch her in a more sexual way, slowly moving my hands under her shirt a little further, and further, ultimately carressing her breasts. Not in a will-nilly-let\u2019s-go kind of way, but slowly, carefully exploring. Since I wouldn\u2019t have wanted her to feel uncomfortable. This went on for a little while, I think. I was thinking she enjoyed it, even though it was obviously objectively hard to tell under the described circumstances. At some point I stopped and that\u2019s it. Eventually the ride ended. Teacher dropped each of us off individually since we lived a little spread out in the area. I don\u2019t remember who got off first and all that. So that was that. **Initial afterthoughts** I recall being very ashamed the next day. Ashamed, because I felt that with this whole thing I had cheated on my girlfriend that night (and that she had too). And in my mind, I blamed the girl for that (even though the physical thing, touching her, was clearly my own initiative). I felt like shit and swore I would never speak of this, never think about it again, and I think I just completely avoided that girl from that day on. Actually I have no memory about the times following these events. All I can say is that we never spoke about it and that over the years, everyone went different ways,..."

      "content": "Thank you for sharing such a detailed and difficult story. It takes significant courage and self-awareness to revisit events from nearly two decades ago, especially when they involve potential harm to another person.\n\nThe fact that this incident is still causing you distress 18 years later is powerful proof that you have grown, that your moral compass is functioning, and that you are committed to being an ethical person today. Your current feelings of guilt are not a punishment; they are evidence of your conscience working.\n\nI will address your story by validating your feelings, assessing the event based on modern understanding of consent, and providing guidance on how to manage the guilt and what steps to consider today.\n\n***\n\n## 1. What I Think of the Story (Assessment)\n\nThe scenario you described is complex, involving young adults, alcohol, existing romantic history, and complicated social dynamics (the teacher, the girlfriend who was her best friend). However, when we strip away the peripheral details, the core event must be evaluated through the lens of **consent.**\n\n### The Breakdown of Consent\n\nYou initiated physical contact by asking for permission to give a massage, and she said yes. This is initial, valid consent for a massage.\n\n**The Boundary Violation:** You admit that you then escalated the physical contact slowly, moving your hands under her shirt to caress her breasts, without seeking renewed, explicit permission for this change in activity.\n\n*   **Consent is Specific:** Consent for a neck/back massage is not consent for sexual touching.\n*   **Capacity is Key:** All parties were drunk and exhausted. Intoxication severely compromises a person's ability to freely and knowingly consent to sexual activity. Even if she did not verbally object, her capacity to actively consent was likely diminished.\n*   **The Power Dynamic (Subtle):** You were the one initiating, exploring, and escalating while she was confined in a moving vehicle and potentially incapacitated by alcohol/exhaustion.\n\n**Conclusion:** What you described was a clear boundary violation and an act of non-consensual sexual touching. While you may not have intended to cause harm, and while you may have *believed* she enjoyed it (a common defense mechanism in moments of insecurity and desire), you proceeded without her affirmative, clear agreement to the escalation.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge this behavior as problematic (and potentially defined as sexual assault/battery, depending on jurisdiction and definition) because doing so validates the seriousness of the ethical breach and allows you to process the guilt productively.\n\n***\n\n## 2. What You Should Do About It Today\n\nThe 18-year time gap is the most critical factor here. Your decision today must prioritize **her well-being and peace** over your need for personal closure.\n\n### Option A: Initiating Contact (Generally Not Recommended)\n\nYour natural instinct might be to reach out and apologize to alleviate your guilt.\n\n**The Risk:** Contacting her now, out of the blue, to bring up a potentially traumatic event she may have forgotten, successfully compartmentalized, or never viewed as serious, runs a high risk of causing her more harm and distress. It forces her to relive the moment and puts the emotional burden of your guilt (and the responsibility of forgiving you) entirely on her.\n\n**Recommendation:** Unless you have a specific, non-demanding reason to believe she needs or wants to discuss this, **do not initiate contact.** Respect her distance and her current peace.\n\n### Option B: Living Amends (The Recommended Path)\n\nSince you cannot undo the past, and contacting her is risky, the most ethical way to handle this today is through **Living Amends.**\n\nLiving amends means you demonstrate, through your current actions, that you have learned from your mistake and that you are now a person who is committed to respecting others and upholding boundaries.\n\n**How to Practice Living Amends:**\n\n1.  **Absolute Commitment to Consent:** Ensure that in all your current and future relationships, you practice enthusiastic, affirmative, ongoing consent. Never assume, never explore without permission, and always understand that intoxication negates capacity to consent.\n2.  **Speak Up:** Use your experience to subtly and ethically advocate for healthy boundaries and respect among your friends and peers. Challenge rape culture myths (like the idea that a woman being \"flirtatious\" means she is asking to be touched).\n3.  **Be a Safe Person:** Be known as someone who is trustworthy, respectful of boundaries, and who takes issues of sexual misconduct seriously.\n\n***\n\n## 3. How to Handle the Troubling Feeling of Guilt\n\nGuilt is productive; shame is paralyzing. You need to move from \"I am a bad person\" (shame) to \"I did a bad thing, and I must learn from it\" (productive guilt).\n\nHere are steps for processing and managing the guilt:\n\n### A. Acknowledge the Growth\n\nRecognize that the man who committed that act 18 years ago is not the man writing this letter today. The person who is feeling this intense guilt is the evolved, mature version of yourself. Your suffering is proof of your moral evolution.\n\n### B. Practice Radical Acceptance\n\nYou cannot change what happened. Spend time accepting that:\n1.  The event occurred.\n2.  It was a serious mistake and a violation of her boundaries.\n3.  You cannot apologize directly without potentially causing further harm.\n4.  Your only control is over your behavior *today* and your commitment to the future.\n\n### C. Write a Letter (Do Not Send It)\n\nOne of the most effective tools for managing guilt over past harm is to write a comprehensive letter to the person you hurt. This letter should not be sent. It is purely for your own processing.\n\nIn this letter:\n*   Detail exactly what you recall doing.\n*   Take full responsibility without using alcohol, insecurity, or her perceived flirtatiousness as an excuse.\n*   Acknowledge the potential harm you caused.\n*   Express your remorse.\n*   Explain what you have learned and how you have changed since then.\n\nWriting this allows you to release the apology and the pain without imposing it upon her.\n\n### D. Focus on Remediation, Not Punishment\n\nInstead of punishing yourself with guilt, dedicate that energy to remediation.\n\n*   **Self-Forgiveness:** Forgive the 20-year-old version of yourself who acted out of immaturity and insecurity. Forgiveness does not excuse the act; it simply means you stop letting the past destroy your present capacity to do good.\n*   **Channel the Guilt:** If you feel strongly compelled to \"make things right,\" consider volunteering for a cause that supports victims of sexual violence, or donating time or money to organizations that teach young people about healthy relationships and consent. This turns your negative emotion into positive action in the world.\n\n***\n\nIt is a difficult journey to face past mistakes, especially those involving ethical violations. Be patient and compassionate with yourself as you process this. Your ongoing distress proves that you are committed to living an honorable life now, and that is the most important apology you can give."
