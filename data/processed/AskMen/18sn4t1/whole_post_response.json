I've been an avid porn user since I was about 11 years old (29 now) and usually jerk 5 to 7 times a week. I'm happy to have a high sex drive but I'm aware this quick dopamine hit is affecting my ability to interact with women I find attractive to the point I'm embarrassed.\n\nNote: I know porn addiction is a relatively newly studied phenomenon and some of you will say its not a thing. Hey, that's great, I'm really happy some people are able to enjoy the content without being mentally effected. Unfortunately I have addiction issues and I don't work like that.\n\nI've been able to overcome many, many addictions but porn has been the one that I can't seem to. I tried SAA, etc. I tend to always relapse. Counselling is not helping either.\n\nI'm trying to find a medium: I want to reset my dopamine and my brain in a sense - I want to feel confident speaking to attractive women (I already gym, improved my fashion, all the stuff that most people suggest) without doing it for the sole purpose of fantasizing/hoping to get laid/being a nervous wreck. but I would ALSO like to be able to release myself. Its been 2 weeks and I'm losing my mind. Unfortunately, I don't think I have that option right now as it very quickly leads to a \"relapse\". Even if I finishing without porn, I end going back to it.\n\nAnybody here have experience with this? Tips? Words of encouragement?"

      "content": "This is a incredibly honest and difficult post to write, and I want to start by commending you heavily for two things:\n\n1.  The self-awareness it takes to identify this pattern and link it directly to your social anxiety and interactions with women.\n2.  The fact that you have successfully overcome *many* other addictions. That is a massive achievement and proves you have the internal discipline necessary to beat this.\n\nIt sounds like you are stuck in the toughest phase of this specific recovery\u2014the point where you are physically and mentally detoxing, and the old coping mechanism is screaming for release.\n\nI have experience with this cycle, and the conflict you\u2019re feeling between needing a reset and needing a release is the central trap of this addiction.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the specific issues you raised, and some strategies that have worked for people in similar situations, focusing on the goal of decoupling release from high-intensity visual stimulation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Addressing the Current Crisis: The 2-Week Mark\n\nYou are at 2 weeks, and you are \"losing your mind.\" This is completely normal and often the peak of withdrawal. Your brain is used to getting an extremely high-quality, zero-effort dopamine hit 5-7 times a week. When you cut that off, your system panics.\n\n**The Cold Truth About the Medium:**\n\nYou are looking for a medium where you can reset your dopamine *and* still release yourself. Unfortunately, for many people struggling with compulsive use, **a true reset requires a defined period of zero sexual release (or at least zero *self-induced* release)**.\n\nSince you noted that even masturbating without porn leads you back to it, your brain has likely hardwired the physical act to the visual stimulus. Attempting to masturbate right now, even without porn, is like an alcoholic attempting to drink non-alcoholic beer during their first month of sobriety\u2014it feeds the ritual and makes the relapse much easier.\n\n### **Tip 1: Extend the Reset (The 90-Day Challenge)**\n\nIf 2 weeks is driving you crazy, aim for 30 days, then 60, then 90. Ninety days is often cited in recovery communities as the minimum time required to significantly downregulate the density of dopamine receptors and allow your brain to find a new baseline.\n\n*   **During this period, the goal is not sexual freedom; the goal is neurochemical peace.**\n\n### **Tip 2: Radical Urge Management**\n\nSince counseling and SAA weren't effective, you need strong behavioral substitutions when the urge hits:\n\n*   **The 5-Minute Rule:** When the urge hits, commit to doing something else *intense* for 5 minutes before you allow yourself to even consider relapsing. This could be a cold shower, 50 pushups, or a 5-minute plank. The goal is to physically shock the system and interrupt the mental pathway.\n*   **Physical Exhaustion:** You already gym, but are you pushing yourself to exhaustion? Intense workouts, especially high-intensity interval training (HIIT) or heavy lifting, can temporarily deplete the nervous energy that often fuels the urge.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Decoupling Confidence from Sexual Fantasy\n\nYou mentioned the core issue is that your rapid dopamine hit is affecting your ability to interact with attractive women without being a nervous wreck or immediately sexualizing them.\n\nThe key here is building **non-sexual social momentum.**\n\nThe reason you are nervous around attractive women is that your brain has categorized them as \"high-stakes sexual endpoints.\" You need to retrain your brain to see them as \"low-stakes human beings.\"\n\n### **Tip 3: The Practice of Low-Stakes Interaction**\n\nYour homework is to practice social interactions with zero sexual agenda. The goal is purely to exchange human energy and build comfort.\n\n*   **The 10-Second Rule:** Force yourself to initiate a 10-second conversation with three women a day in non-flirty contexts (e.g., the barista, the cashier, a coworker, the elderly woman walking her dog).\n    *   *Example:* \"That jacket is great, where did you get it?\" or \"Man, this line is crazy today.\"\n*   **Focus on Function, Not Form:** When talking to an attractive woman, consciously shift your focus from her appearance to the logistics of the interaction. Are you listening? Are you making eye contact? Are you genuinely interested in what she is saying?\n*   **The \"Friend Test\":** Before you interact, imagine this woman is your friend's sister or colleague. How would you behave? This helps you switch from \"predator/nervous wreck\" mode to \"respectful acquaintance\" mode.\n\n### **Tip 4: Re-evaluating Your Motivation**\n\nYou said you are doing the gym, fashion, etc., but worry you are doing it for the sole purpose of fantasizing/hoping to get laid.\n\nThis is a common realization. You have to pivot the reason you do these things.\n\n*   **Shift the Metric:** Stop measuring your self-improvement by how many compliments you get or how many women look at you. Measure it by internal metrics: *How did I feel after that workout? Am I proud of how I handled that difficult conversation?*\n*   **Pursue Competence:** Focus your energy on becoming competent in something that has nothing to do with your appearance or women\u2014a new language, a difficult professional certification, a complex hobby. Confidence derived from demonstrable skill is far more stable than confidence derived from external validation.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Finding the Sustainable Release (The Long-Term Goal)\n\nThe goal is to eventually be able to release yourself in a healthy way that does not trigger a relapse.\n\nThis usually requires two steps that can only be taken *after* a significant reset period (like the 90 days):\n\n### **Tip 5: Redefine Masturbation**\n\nWhen you eventually reintroduce masturbation, it must be radically different from the old habit.\n\n*   **No Visuals:** This is non-negotiable. No internet, no screens, no fantasy based on specific real people.\n*   **Focus on Sensation (Mindful Release):** This is the hardest part. The goal is to focus purely on the physical sensation and the breath, allowing your brain to generate the necessary arousal naturally, without high-intensity visual input. The purpose is release, not intense dopamine spiking.\n*   **Schedule It:** Do not allow it to be a spontaneous coping mechanism. Schedule it (e.g., once a week, Sunday morning). If you feel an urge outside that time, you refer back to Tip 2 (Urge Management).\n\n### **Words of Encouragement**\n\nYou have already done the hardest part: you identified the problem and you are fighting it. The fact that you have successfully overcome other addictions means you have the playbook for recovery\u2014you just need to apply it ruthlessly here.\n\nThis is not a failure of character; it is a neurological habit that takes time and effort to rewire. Be patient with yourself, but be uncompromising with the habit.\n\nThe anxiety you feel around women is not permanent. As you clean up the dopamine pathways, you will find that your baseline level of confidence increases, and those interactions will feel less like high-stakes performance tests and more like normal human connections.\n\nYou are 2 weeks in. Keep going. You have the strength for this."
