When I was 7 or 8 I was sexually abused multiple times by two different family members. As a result, I've never been able to form a serious relationship and have intimacy issues. I've never told anyone about this. Before some of you tell me to seek professional help, I have considered going to see a therapist but I don't have the money or time right now. \n\nAnyways, I'm in my early 20's and finally like who I am and feel good about myself. I've tried online dating and have had an overall okay experience. My problem is that every time I feel like something good could happen, I tend to push people away or shut down. I just don't know when to tell someone I'd like to date about this. I guess I'm afraid of what they'll think of me, or that they won't be interested anymore. I know, those aren't the guys worth my time anyway.\n\nI don't want to miss out on someone I see potential with anymore. Men, please help!"

      "content": "This is an incredibly brave thing to share, and I want to start by acknowledging the immense strength it takes to carry this and, simultaneously, be willing to open yourself up to potential relationships. The fact that you are in your early 20s and have reached a point where you feel good about who you are is a massive achievement.\n\nIt is completely understandable that when things feel good, your instinct is to push people away. This is a classic protective mechanism\u2014you are trying to prevent anticipated pain or rejection by controlling the outcome.\n\nWhile I cannot speak for all men, I can offer guidance on the timing and approach that generally fosters trust and leads to a supportive outcome in a healthy relationship.\n\n---\n\n## When to Share: The Timing Sweet Spot\n\nThe consensus among people who are looking for a serious, committed relationship is that disclosure of significant trauma should happen when the relationship is transitioning from casual dating into a defined, serious partnership.\n\nHere is a breakdown of when it is generally **too early**, when it is **just right**, and when it might be **too late**:\n\n### 1. Too Early: First Few Dates (Dates 1\u20135)\n\n*   **Why:** On a first date, the focus is on chemistry, shared values, and basic compatibility. Dropping heavy trauma early can overwhelm a potential partner who doesn't yet have an emotional investment in you. They might struggle to differentiate between who you are now and the weight of your past experience.\n*   **What to Focus On:** During this phase, you are assessing if they are safe, kind, and respectful. You are building connection, not sharing your deepest wounds.\n\n### 2. The Sweet Spot: When Commitment is Discussed (The \"Exclusivity Talk\")\n\n*   **This is the ideal time.** You should share this information when you have established trust, defined the relationship (e.g., agreed to be exclusive), and when physical intimacy or deep emotional vulnerability is on the immediate horizon.\n*   **Why:** By this point, the man is interested in *you* as a person. He has invested time and emotion. He sees a future with you. When you share something difficult at this stage, he understands it is part of the package of the person he already cares about.\n*   **The Crucial Factor:** You need to feel safe with him. If you don't feel safe, it's not the right time, or perhaps he's not the right person.\n\n### 3. Too Late: After Deep Intimacy or Engagement\n\n*   **Why:** If you wait until you are fully living together, engaged, or have been intimate many times, your partner may feel blindsided or betrayed by the omission, especially since your trauma directly affects intimacy. It can feel like a fundamental piece of information was withheld during a critical period of relationship building.\n\n---\n\n## How to Communicate This Information\n\nYou do not need to share graphic details, especially not in the beginning. You need to communicate the **impact** that the trauma has on your current relationship dynamics.\n\nWhen you decide to share, frame the conversation around the relationship's future and your commitment to making it work.\n\n### Step 1: Set the Stage\n\nFind a quiet, private moment. Start by affirming the relationship.\n\n> \"I care about you a lot, and I see real potential here. Because I want this to be successful, there is something important about my past I need to share with you, as it affects how I navigate emotional and physical intimacy.\"\n\n### Step 2: Share the Impact, Not Just the Event\n\nYou are not obligated to say, \"I was sexually abused.\" You can choose language that makes you feel comfortable while still being honest about the challenge.\n\n**Example Phrases Focused on Relationship Impact:**\n\n*   \"I have a history of past trauma that has created some intimacy issues for me. I sometimes struggle with physical closeness, and I need a partner who is patient and understanding as I continue to work through this.\"\n*   \"Because of difficult things that happened when I was young, sometimes when I feel overwhelmed or close to someone, I tend to shut down or pull away. I want you to know that this is never about you; it's just my protective mechanism kicking in.\"\n\n### Step 3: Give Him a Chance to Respond\n\nAfter you share, pause and let him process. A supportive partner will likely respond with concern for *you*, not immediate judgment or fear.\n\n**Look for these reactions:**\n\n*   **Supportive:** \"Thank you for trusting me with this. That must have been incredibly difficult. How can I best support you when you feel triggered?\"\n*   **Unsupportive/Red Flag:** \"Oh, I can fix that,\" or \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\" or immediately pulling away.\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Your Fears\n\nYour fear of rejection is valid, but you are right: those are not the guys worth your time.\n\n**Think of this information as a powerful filter.**\n\nA truly good partner\u2014one who is mature, empathetic, and ready for a serious relationship\u2014will understand that everyone comes with a past. Your past is not a reflection of your worth; it is a testament to your resilience.\n\nIf a man runs away solely because you disclose that you have had trauma and need patience, he is showing you immediately that he lacks the emotional maturity and capacity for compassion required for a serious relationship. You save yourself weeks or months of heartache by letting him filter himself out.\n\nYou are moving forward, you are feeling good about yourself, and you are ready to explore healthy relationships. Trust your gut, prioritize your safety, and remember that vulnerability is the highest form of courage."
