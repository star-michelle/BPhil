I say no, I'm staying with my husband, enough is enough. Then he guilt trips me after I go no contact (it works). I'm starting to get scared that he's going to do something crazy to me or my husband, so that's part of why I fail at going no contact. How do I get him to go away for good?"

      "content": "This is a deeply distressing and scary situation, and I am so sorry you are going through this. It is completely understandable that you feel stressed, frustrated, and increasingly frightened.\n\nFirst, I want to emphasize that **none of this is your fault.** You have clearly set boundaries, rejected his advances, and attempted to go no contact. His refusal to respect your decisions and your marriage is entirely his responsibility.\n\nYour fear is a very valid reaction, especially since his behavior is escalating (begging, guilt-tripping, and persistent contact despite rejection). This kind of persistent, unwanted contact is harassment and stalking, and it needs to be addressed with safety as the absolute priority.\n\nHere is a structured approach combining immediate safety measures, documentation, and legal options to help you get him to go away for good:\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Immediate Safety and Documentation\n\n### 1. Prioritize Safety (Yours and Your Husband's)\n\n*   **Inform Your Husband Fully:** Make sure your husband knows the full extent of this man's behavior, the threats, and the current level of concern. He is your partner, and you should tackle this as a team.\n*   **Review Home Security:** Ensure all doors and windows lock securely. Consider installing motion-activated lights or a simple doorbell camera (like Ring or Nest) if you don't have one, as this provides documentation of anyone approaching your home.\n*   **Change Routine (Temporarily):** Avoid walking alone at night or taking the same route to work. Vary your schedule slightly until this situation is resolved.\n\n### 2. Go Strict No Contact (Again)\n\nThis is the hardest part, especially when you are worried, but breaking contact only reinforces to him that persistence works.\n\n*   **Block Everything:** Block his number, email addresses, and all social media accounts. Do not respond to texts, calls, or messages, even if they are guilt-tripping or seem innocuous.\n*   **Do Not Explain:** Do not send one final message explaining why you are blocking him. Any response is seen as engagement.\n*   **Silence is Key:** If he tries to contact you through a third party (a mutual friend), inform that person that you are dealing with a harassment issue and have gone no contact, and ask them not to pass messages along.\n\n### 3. Document Everything\n\nThis is crucial if you need to involve law enforcement or seek a restraining order.\n\n*   **Create a Log:** Start a detailed log (digital or physical) of every interaction. Include:\n    *   **Date and Time** of the contact.\n    *   **Method** (Text, email, social media, physical appearance).\n    *   **Content** (Quote the message or describe the interaction briefly).\n    *   **Your Action** (e.g., \"Blocked number,\" \"Did not respond\").\n*   **Save Evidence:** Take screenshots of all texts, emails, and social media messages. Do not delete them.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Utilizing Legal and Professional Resources\n\nGiven the level of harassment and the fact that you are starting to fear for your safety, involving professionals is the necessary next step.\n\n### 4. Send a Formal Cease and Desist Letter\n\nBefore seeking a restraining order, a formal letter often serves as strong evidence that you explicitly demanded he stop.\n\n*   **How to do it:** You can write this yourself, but it is much more effective if a lawyer writes and sends it.\n*   **Content:** The letter should be brief, formal, and unequivocally state that all contact must cease immediately. It should warn him that any future contact will be considered harassment and will result in legal action (police report and/or restraining order).\n*   **Delivery:** Send it via certified mail (or have the lawyer send it) so you have proof he received the demand.\n\n### 5. Contact Law Enforcement (The Police)\n\nYou do not have to wait for a physical threat to contact the police. Persistent harassment and stalking are crimes.\n\n*   **File a Report:** Go to your local police department (or use their non-emergency line) and explain that you are being stalked/harassed. Use your documentation log.\n*   **The Goal:** Even if the police don't arrest him immediately, having an official police report on file establishes a legal record of his behavior. This documentation is vital for obtaining a restraining order.\n\n### 6. Seek a Restraining Order (Order of Protection)\n\nIf the Cease and Desist letter and police report do not stop him, or if he escalates his behavior, you need to seek a court-issued Order of Protection (the name varies by state/country).\n\n*   **Grounds:** Persistent unwanted communication, harassment, and fearing for your safety and the safety of your husband are generally sufficient grounds.\n*   **Effect:** If granted, this is a court order that legally prohibits him from contacting you, coming within a specific distance of your home, workplace, or person. If he violates it, he can be immediately arrested.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 3: Seeking Support\n\nDealing with stalking takes an emotional toll. You do not have to handle the fear alone.\n\n### 7. Utilize Stalking and Domestic Violence Resources\n\nWhile he is not your spouse, the dynamics of his behavior fall under patterns recognized by harassment and stalking support organizations. They can provide legal guidance and emotional support tailored to your situation.\n\n*   **The National Center for Victims of Crime (Stalking Resource Center):** They have excellent resources and hotlines for people dealing with stalking.\n*   **Local Domestic Violence/Crisis Centers:** They often have advocates who can help you navigate the process of filing police reports and obtaining restraining orders.\n\n**You are doing the right thing by trying to end this.** Focus on documenting his behavior and utilizing legal channels. Once the legal process is initiated, the responsibility of enforcing the boundary shifts from you to the authorities."
