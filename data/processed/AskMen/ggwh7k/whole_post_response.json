I regret not doing a lot of things with him and I regret that we didn\u2019t talk as much as we should have."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult time, and I am so very sorry for the loss of your best friend. Losing someone so close is devastating, and it\u2019s completely understandable that you feel lost, depressed, and overwhelmed right now.\n\nPlease know that there is no single \"correct\" way to mourn. Grief is a deeply personal process, and what you are experiencing\u2014the shift between trying to be positive and falling back into depression, the loss of appetite, and the crushing weight of regret\u2014is all a very normal part of the initial shock and pain.\n\nIt sounds like you are wrestling with several intense feelings at once. Let's talk through what you've shared:\n\n### 1. The Conflict Between Positivity and Depression\n\n> \"I keep on trying to make myself more positive but once I remind myself I end up being depressed.\"\n\n**What to consider:** Right now, your system is flooded with pain. Trying to force yourself to be positive is essentially trying to skip the essential step of processing the sadness. Grief requires space.\n\n**Instead of forcing positivity, try allowing the sadness:**\n\n* **Give yourself permission to feel awful.** It is okay to be depressed right now. You just experienced a profound loss. This is not a time for forced happiness; it's a time for mourning.\n* **Think of grief in waves.** Sometimes the pain will crash over you, and sometimes you will have a moment of respite. When the wave hits, ride it out (cry, scream into a pillow, write down the sadness). When the wave recedes, don't feel guilty for the brief moment of peace.\n\n### 2. Physical Symptoms and Self-Care\n\n> \"I lost my appetite and don\u2019t want to eat anything at all.\"\n\nIt is very common for stress and grief to shut down your appetite. However, your body needs fuel, especially when you are under this much emotional stress.\n\n**Practical steps for eating right now:**\n\n* **Focus on hydration.** Make sure you are drinking water, tea, or sports drinks. Dehydration will make the emotional pain feel worse.\n* **Small, bland, and frequent.** Don't try to eat a full meal. Focus on tiny snacks throughout the day: a handful of nuts, a piece of toast, yogurt, a smoothie, or soup. The goal is to get calories in, not to enjoy the food.\n* **Ask someone to help.** If you have family or friends nearby, can someone prepare a simple meal for you or just sit with you while you try to eat a few bites?\n\n### 3. Dealing with Regret and Unfinished Business\n\n> \"I regret not doing a lot of things with him and I regret that we didn\u2019t talk as much as we should have.\"\n\nThis is one of the hardest parts of loss. Regret piles on top of the sadness, making the burden heavier.\n\n**What you can do with those regrets now:**\n\n* **Write a letter.** Since you can't talk to him anymore, write down everything you wish you had said, everything you regret, and everything you loved about him. This is a way to complete the unfinished conversation and release those thoughts from your mind. You don't have to show anyone the letter.\n* **Focus on the connection you *did* have.** While you may regret what wasn't done, try to gently shift your focus (even for a moment) to the incredible bond you shared. He was your best friend. That connection was real and meaningful, regardless of any missed conversations.\n\n### How to \"Mourn\" Moving Forward\n\nMourning is less about following rules and more about allowing yourself to process the reality of the loss. Here are a few ways people find comfort:\n\n1. **Talk about him:** Don't avoid his name. Share a funny story with someone who knew him, or even tell a stranger what he was like. Keeping his memory alive is a powerful way to honor him.\n2. **Accept support:** If people offer to help, say yes. They can run errands, bring food, or just sit quietly with you. You do not have to go through this alone.\n3. **Be kind to yourself:** Lower your expectations for productivity. For the next few days (or weeks), your main job is simply to survive and take care of your basic needs. If you need to stay in bed, stay in bed. If you need to watch a silly movie, watch a silly movie.\n\nPlease be gentle with yourself. You are in the very early stages of grief. This pain is a reflection of how much you loved your friend.\n\n**How are you managing right now? Do you have anyone physically with you who can offer immediate support?**"
