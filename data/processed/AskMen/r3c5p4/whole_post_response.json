This post ended up being much longer than I expected, but I feel like it's all pretty important because I still have these issues/thoughts about anyone and everyone else that I'm interested in. And a lot of this sounds like you have to explain it to me like I'm a five year old, and I'd honestly prefer it if you did. I'll always be willing to look dumb in the pursuit of improvement. I'm hoping that this is just a unique enough situation to warrant this post not violating rule 4.\n\nI'm a 26 year old physically disabled guy. I have a muscular condition, which is essentially like ALS, but not AS severe in my case. Because I've been shy and anxious ever since I can remember, I never really got \"broken out of my shell\". On Tinder I've switched up the way I interact with women. In essence, I do my best to entirely ignore my anxiety and just go balls to the wall with my personality and I say things that are completely fine (likely) to say, but if I listened to my anxiety, I would never. It's working out pretty well! Fake it til you make it style.\n\nHowever, at the end of the day, I still do have anxiety, and I'm even more inexperienced than you can imagine. For example, I'm not physically strong enough to do the five knuckle shuffle myself, so nudes don't really do much for me. I mean. They do, but I can't do anything about it which has led me to basically look at nudes through an artistic appreciation lens if that makes any sense. Anxiety, the no 5 knuckle shuffle, and the inexperience make me absolutely fucking awful at dirty talk. (How do you all know what they want to hear during impromptu dirty talk that you initiate?) So! I of course second guess myself a lot. Some of these questions might have painfully obvious answers, but, again, anxiety. And others aren't as obvious, but I would love to hear people's thoughts.\n\nI know that I don't look all that attractive physically to most, but I don't even care about that, because if just my looks are a deal breaker, then I consider that a dodged bullet for sure. A lot of my charm is my jokes and me being smooth. I do super well over text, but thinking about saying certain stuff in person with my limitations doesn't sound very smooth. For example, I've been talking to a girl on Tinder for a few weeks and I've told her that given the opportunity, I would love to \"tap that ass into orbit\". That was also pretty early on, she's still seemingly interested, and she lives about 40 miles away. She plans on coming here to hang out soon. Tonight I asked her to send me a wet hair selfie after her shower because \"wet hair selfies make my knees go weak\". Smooth, right? She sent me a selfie where you can tell that she meticulously showed more than she \"had\" to, but covered her nipple with her hair. I called her out in a joking/teasing way and she all but said that she was teasing me.\n\nShe's a super cool person. Super adventurous type. I asked her if she wanted to see a movie, get dinner, chill at my place or tie a skateboard to the back of my chair and cruise around Walmart and she goes \"Why not all of the above?\" which gave me a raging heart-on. She's a goofball like I am.\n\nNow. Here's where my mental block is. Being funny and smooth is my best moves besides manufactured confidence. Because of my disability, I can't really move much. So I can't really initiate anything in the most traditional ways. I have to use my words. \"Hey wanna fuck?\" or \"let me kiss you\" just doesn't...sound smooth or charming when I imagine it. Am I just too into my own head about it? Or, preferably, can you guys think of any more in character (funny/witty) ways to ask?\n\nThat's the difficult one. I seem to be doing well at knowing when someone is interested and is/or flirting. But if you guys have any thoughts on what I should look for in that area too, that would be super appreciated! Even if you feel like it's blatantly obvious, please do share still. Because besides the fake it til you make it part, I sincerely don't have any fucking clue what I'm doing even if it seems like I do. On her Tinder bio she said that she wasn't looking for anything serious, but she also deleted her account too. So even if someone isn't looking for something serious, they have the potential to find it anyway.\n\nProbably another very obvious answer, but I want to make sure from people who are far more experienced than myself. I early on mentioned tapping that ass into orbit, her profile originally said nothing serious, she sent me flirty photos, and she's going to drive 40 miles to hang out with me. Is it pretty safe to assume that she's down to have her ass tapped into orbit? That distance sucks, but I'm also definitely capable of getting to her as well.\n\nAnd just advice in general in this area would be fantastic. How to pick up girls in general. Honestly anything you can think of. Pretend I'm your son and you're teaching me how to ride a bike that I didn't even know existed.\n\nAgain, I apologize for the lengthy post! I've wondered about a lot of this for a LONG time."

      "content": "This is an incredibly thoughtful and brave post. Thank you for sharing such a detailed and honest account of where you are right now.\n\nI want to start by saying: **You are doing everything right.**\n\nSeriously. The fact that you are ignoring your anxiety, going \"balls to the wall\" with your personality, and using manufactured confidence to successfully connect with women is not only working, it's the textbook definition of how to manage anxiety and build new behavioral patterns. You have already won the hardest battle.\n\nLet\u2019s break down your questions on disability, anxiety, and dating, piece by piece, exactly as you requested.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Anxiety and Confidence (The Mental Block)\n\nYour question about being \"too into your own head\" is the key here. Yes, you are. But that\u2019s okay, because that\u2019s what anxiety does\u2014it forces you to over-analyze simple human interactions until they seem impossible.\n\n### The \"Fake It 'Til You Make It\" Strategy\n\nYou asked for the 5-year-old explanation:\n\n*   **Anxiety\u2019s Job:** Anxiety is a liar. Its job is to keep you safe by predicting the worst-case scenario (rejection, awkwardness). It makes you freeze.\n*   **Your Strategy:** You are fighting the liar by acting like the person you want to be (smooth, confident, witty).\n*   **The Result:** When you act confident, you get positive results (like the girl driving 40 miles). Those positive results start chipping away at the anxiety\u2019s credibility. Eventually, the confidence won\u2019t feel entirely fake\u2014it will become your default setting. Keep ignoring the anxious voice. It\u2019s noise, not truth.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Disability and Attraction\n\nYou are 100% correct about your physical appearance being a filter.\n\n### The Dodged Bullet Theory\n\nIf a woman is put off purely by your disability, she is rejecting the *vessel*, not the *person*. Since you are looking for someone who appreciates your charm, wit, and goofiness, her rejection is a service to you. You are filtering out shallow people efficiently.\n\n**Your Charm is Your Strength:** Your confidence, humor, and ability to communicate desire are your most potent tools. They are working over text, and they will work in person. Physical strength is *one* way to be attractive; communication and confidence are *the* ways to be attractive.\n\n### Regarding the \"5 Knuckle Shuffle\" and Nudes\n\nIt is perfectly valid, given your physical limitations, to view nudes through an \"artistic appreciation lens.\" This doesn't make you less of a man or less interested in sex. It simply means your body processes arousal differently.\n\nWhen you get to the point of physical intimacy with a partner, the focus shifts to mutual pleasure and connection. Your limitations simply mean you communicate and direct that pleasure differently. A good partner will be excited to explore what works for *both* of you.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Interpreting Signals (Is She Down?)\n\nYou asked for a very obvious answer, and I will give you one.\n\n| Evidence | Interpretation (Like I'm 5) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Early on:** You mentioned \"tap that ass into orbit.\" | This is a highly suggestive, sexual joke. |\n| **Her Reaction:** She stayed interested. | She accepted the sexual frame of the conversation. |\n| **Her Teasing:** She sent a meticulous, covered nude and admitted to teasing you. | She is enjoying the sexual tension and wants you to keep chasing. |\n| **Her Plans:** \"Why not all of the above?\" (Dinner, movie, chilling, skate-chair racing). | She is excited to spend extended time with you and is highly engaged. |\n| **The Drive:** She is driving 40 miles. | People do not drive 40 miles for a platonic movie night. |\n| **She Deleted Tinder:** | She is focused on you, even if it's just for a fun hookup right now. |\n\n**Conclusion:** It is **extremely safe** to assume that she is down to have her ass tapped into orbit. Her actions indicate she is looking for fun, connection, and likely physical intimacy.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Initiating Intimacy (The Smoothest Move)\n\nThis is your biggest mental block: How to initiate without using traditional physical moves (leaning in, placing a hand, etc.).\n\nSince you rely on your wit and charm, your initiation must be **verbal, direct, and delivered with manufactured confidence.**\n\n### The Escalation Strategy\n\nThe goal is to move from conversation to physical intimacy in stages, using your words to replace the physical cues you can\u2019t easily provide.\n\n**Step 1: The Compliment/Desire Bridge**\nMove the conversation from funny to intimate. Use your smooth language to articulate what you want.\n\n*   **Example (Smooth/Witty):** \"You know, you\u2019re so funny that I\u2019m actually having trouble focusing on what you\u2019re saying right now. I keep thinking about what it would be like to just kiss you.\"\n*   **Example (Direct/Teasing):** \"I\u2019ve been waiting for you to get here for weeks. And now that you are, I\u2019m realizing I want to stop talking and start doing something else. [Pause] Like making out.\"\n\n**Step 2: The Direct Ask (The Initiation)**\nOnce you\u2019ve set the tone, you need to ask for permission to bridge the physical gap. This is where you replace the \"lean in\" with a confident, slightly demanding phrase.\n\n*   **The \"Let Me Kiss You\" Problem:** You said this sounds clunky. It does.\n*   **The Fix (Use a Statement):** Instead of asking a question, make a statement that implies action, and then wait for her non-verbal acceptance (or verbal rejection).\n\n| Clunky Question | Smooth Statement (Using Your Persona) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| \"Can I kiss you?\" | \"I really want to kiss you right now.\" |\n| \"Wanna hook up?\" | \"If you don't kiss me soon, I'm going to lose my mind.\" |\n| \"Hey wanna fuck?\" | \"We should probably stop talking before I get arrested for all the things I want to do to you.\" (Wait for her smile/giggle, then move to the kiss.) |\n\n**Step 3: The Physical Bridge**\nEven if you can\u2019t move much, use whatever dexterity you have to bridge the gap after your smooth line.\n\n*   If you can reach her hand, take it.\n*   If she is close, look her directly in the eyes, smile, and then look at her lips.\n*   **Crucial Move:** After your smooth statement (\"I really want to kiss you right now\"), **pause** and hold eye contact. If she smiles, leans in slightly, or doesn't pull away, that\u2019s your non-verbal acceptance.\n\n**Summary:** Your smoothness isn't in your body movement; it's in your ability to articulate desire confidently.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Dirty Talk (The Improv Challenge)\n\nYou struggle with dirty talk because it feels like high-stakes improv. You are worried about saying the \"wrong\" thing.\n\n### How to Know What They Want to Hear (The 5-Year-Old Rule)\n\n**You don't need to know what they want to hear. You just need to tell them what *you* want to do.**\n\nDirty talk is about expressing desire and building anticipation. It's not a quiz.\n\n1.  **Start Simple (Focus on Her):** When you are texting or in person, compliment her in a sexual way.\n    *   *Instead of:* \"You're hot.\"\n    *   *Try:* \"That shirt is a problem. I\u2019m going to have to rip it off you.\"\n    *   *Try:* \"I can\u2019t stop thinking about the expression you\u2019ll make when I [insert desired action].\"\n\n2.  **Focus on Senses and Action (The Action Plan):** Tell her exactly what you are going to do to her or what you wish she was doing to you.\n\n| Situation | Dirty Talk Example (Confident & Simple) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Texting about the date | \"I hope you brought your A-game, because I plan on leaving you speechless.\" |\n| She sends a photo | \"You have no idea how much trouble you just caused me.\" |\n| In person, leading to a kiss | \"I\u2019m going to kiss you so hard you forget your name.\" |\n\n**The Confidence Factor:** Deliver these lines with the same manufactured confidence you use on Tinder. The success of dirty talk is 90% delivery, 10% content. If you say something simple but sound like you mean it, it will land.\n\n---\n\n## 6. General Advice (Riding the Bike)\n\nPretend I am teaching you how to ride a bike. Here are the three most important rules for dating and hookups:\n\n### A. The Date is a Series of Tests\n\nA date is less about finding common interests and more about testing for chemistry and boundaries.\n\n*   **Test 1 (The Vibe):** Is the conversation fun? (You ace this.)\n*   **Test 2 (The Flirt):** Are you escalating the flirting? Are you introducing sexual tension? (You\u2019re doing this over text; bring it into the conversation.)\n*   **Test 3 (The Touch/Physicality):** For you, this means using your words to set the expectation of physical intimacy.\n\n### B. Be the Director\n\nGiven your limitations, you need to be very comfortable directing the action. This is not a weakness; it is a strength.\n\n*   **Be Direct:** If you want a kiss, ask for it using your smooth line.\n*   **Be Clear:** If you are physically limited in certain ways, you need to be comfortable communicating that early in the physical interaction. A good partner will appreciate the clarity and will be excited to find ways to please you (and themselves) that work for your body.\n\n### C. Consent is Sexy\n\nWhen you use your verbal initiation, you are asking for consent in a charming way. When she accepts, her enthusiasm is your green light.\n\n**Final Thought:**\n\nYou are a witty, charming guy who has successfully overcome significant social anxiety. You\u2019ve used your disability not as a barrier, but as a filter to find high-quality partners. Do not let the last 5% (the initiation) sabotage the 95% you have already mastered (the connection and confidence).\n\nKeep faking it. You are closer to making it than you think. Good luck!"
