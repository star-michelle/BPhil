He had become so negative, lazy, undependable and started undermining me every chance he got when it came to parenting. I was so sure I was done with the relationship as he seemed unwilling to try to talk and attempt to work through our problems even though he kept saying he didn't want to break up. \n\nWell we got into a big fight in the beginning of this month and he finally opened up to me (which I know is really hard for him to do) and he told me that he's been feeling resentful towards me for a long time. He feels as though once I became a mom, I stopped being his partner. That I put all of myself into our son and our home and I don't leave anything left for him. That our relationship has become me telling him what to do and treating him more like an employee than my partner. \n\nI feel like such an arsehole. Since he told me that, it's all I can see. I was 24 when I got pregnant and once I had our son I knew I had to grow up so I kind of faked it until you make it kind of thing. It's like I hyper focused on being a mom and nothing else and of course having a kid makes it very hard to get any alone time so I must have just let our relationship fade into the background. \n\nI love this man with every part of me and I have since the moment I laid eyes on him and honestly I never intended for things to go this way so\u00a0 I'm looking for any advice on ways I can make him feel like/show him I care about him and that our relationship is important to me. Or behaviors I should be changing, traditions/habits I could start so he knows I prioritize him (example could be making his favorite meal every whatever day of the month, so even if that day is a day that I'm exhausted, he knows that I still made it because I love him) \n\nI've only been able to think of things from a womans perspective so I'm hoping some of you can tell me what you would like as a man or what has your SO done to make you feel like a priority. I know what I'm asking may sound confusing but hopefully you can understand it enough Haha \n\nPlease keep in mind that he's a recovering alcoholic so nothing to do with drinking or going out to a bar ect. We've also never hired a babysitter or left our son with family so that we could have time to ourselves but I would be willing to do so if you think it would help."

      "content": "This is a really insightful and honest post. It takes immense courage to look at a difficult situation, recognize your own role in it, and commit to making changes. You are absolutely not an \"arsehole\"; you are a dedicated mother who, like many parents, navigated the massive shift of parenthood by focusing on survival and responsibility. It\u2019s completely understandable how your relationship got sidelined.\n\nThe good news is that your partner opened up, and now you have a clear path forward. You both still love each other deeply, and that is a powerful foundation to rebuild upon.\n\nIt's smart that you are specifically asking for advice from a male perspective on feeling prioritized, as needs often differ. Based on what your partner said\u2014feeling like an employee, feeling resentful, feeling like you stopped being his partner\u2014the solutions often center less on grand gestures and more on **respect, connection, and shared identity outside of parenting.**\n\nHere are some actionable ideas, categorized by the core needs you are trying to address:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Re-establishing Partnership and Respect\n\nYour partner mentioned feeling like an employee and being told what to do. This suggests he feels controlled, criticized, and undervalued in his role as a partner and father.\n\n### Actionable Steps:\n\n*   **Change the Communication Dynamic:** Stop giving instructions and start asking for collaboration.\n    *   **Instead of:** \"You need to take out the trash and finish the laundry before dinner.\"\n    *   **Try:** \"Hey, I'm feeling overwhelmed by all these chores. Could we sit down for five minutes and figure out the plan for the weekend? What two things do you think would be most helpful if you tackled?\"\n*   **Acknowledge His Contributions (The 3:1 Rule):** For every constructive criticism or request, try to give him at least three genuine acknowledgments of what he *is* doing right.\n    *   \"Thank you so much for handling the morning routine today; it really allowed me to focus on work.\"\n    *   \"I really appreciate how patient you were with [son] when he was having that tantrum.\"\n*   **Ask for His Opinion and Defer to It:** When it comes to the house or the son, genuinely seek his input and sometimes let him lead, even if his way is slightly different from yours. This shows you trust him as a competent partner.\n    *   \"I was thinking about how to handle [son's] homework routine. What are your thoughts on that? I\u2019m open to suggestions.\"\n    *   If he handles a situation differently than you would, **resist the urge to criticize or correct him immediately.** Let him have autonomy.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Intentional Connection and Shared Identity\n\nHe misses his partner, the woman he fell in love with, and the connection you shared before the hyper-focus on motherhood took over.\n\n### Actionable Steps:\n\n*   **The \"5-Minute Check-In\" (Without discussing the kid or chores):** When you reconnect in the evening, set a boundary: the first five to ten minutes are only for discussing *your* lives and *your* day. Ask him about his job, his interests, a book he\u2019s reading, or a funny story from his day.\n    *   **Ask Open-Ended Questions:** \"What was the most frustrating part of your day?\" \"What made you laugh today?\" \"Tell me about that project you're working on.\"\n*   **Date Night (Even if it's at home):** Since you haven't used sitters, start small. Put your son to bed an hour earlier one night a week.\n    *   **The Rule:** Once the door is closed, you are **partners, not parents.** Put phones away. Watch a movie you both enjoy, play a board game, or just sit and talk like you did when you were dating. This is critical for remembering who you are as a couple.\n    *   If you are willing to try a sitter, even once a month, that physical separation from the house and the routine can be incredibly rejuvenating.\n*   **Physical Affection (Non-Sexual):** Prioritize physical closeness. Men often interpret physical affection as a direct sign of emotional connection and prioritization. This could be holding hands while watching TV, a long hug when he walks in the door, or simply sitting shoulder-to-shoulder.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Showing You Care Through Actions (The Priority Examples)\n\nYou asked for specific habits or traditions. These are things that require effort and show him that his needs are considered, even when you are exhausted.\n\n### Actionable Steps:\n\n*   **The Dedicated Meal:** Your idea of making his favorite meal regularly is fantastic. **Make it a ritual.** Maybe it's the 15th of every month, or every Sunday. Even better: make it a meal that feels like a treat just for him (e.g., a perfect steak, his favorite lasagna). This shows planning and thought specifically for his enjoyment.\n*   **Focus on His Interests:** Show genuine interest in his hobbies or things he cares about.\n    *   If he likes a certain sport, make sure you know when his team is playing and put it on the TV. Sit with him for 15 minutes and ask him about the game.\n    *   If he has a small project he\u2019s working on (a repair, a hobby), ask him how it\u2019s going and offer to help (even if your help is just bringing him a coffee).\n*   **The Recovery Respect:** Given his history as a recovering alcoholic, supporting his sobriety is a huge way to show you prioritize him.\n    *   Ask him specifically, \"What do you need from me right now to feel supported in your sobriety?\"\n    *   Make sure your home environment is a safe space for him. If he attends meetings, actively support the time he needs to do so without making him feel guilty for leaving.\n\n---\n\n## A Note on the Logistics (The Distance)\n\nRight now, he is an hour away, which makes rebuilding hard. Use this time for high-quality connection:\n\n1.  **Scheduled Calls:** Don't just rely on quick texts. Schedule a 30-minute call where you can talk through the ideas above (the 5-minute check-in rules apply here, too).\n2.  **Look Forward:** Focus your conversations on what you are excited to do *together* when he is back. \"I can't wait until you're home so we can try that new recipe.\"\n3.  **Address the Return:** Before he moves back, you both need to agree on a few basic house rules/expectations to prevent the resentment cycle from starting again. This should be about partnership, not delegation.\n\nYou have recognized the problem, and that is the hardest step. By focusing on respect, communication, and showing him you value the man *outside* of his role as a father, you can absolutely begin to heal and strengthen your partnership. Good luck."
