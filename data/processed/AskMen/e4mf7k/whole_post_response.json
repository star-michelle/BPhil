We basically did the same stuff as we did when together except the sex stopped like a month ago. Shortly after that i guess she started talking to some dude and took a liking to him.\n\nAt first it didn\u2019t bother me, but then her sister showed up and it just got worse for me. Im not trying to listen, but i can hear her talking about having sex with him and thats when it started bugging me. I mean come on, we cool but I\u2019m not trying to hear that. They talking for s couple week or a month I think then last night, she heads to meet ol\u2019 boy with her sister, a double date or something. (Left at about 8:30 pm)\nShe shares her location with me in case some shit go down.\n4:30 am rolls around and her sister pops back at the house alone. She left her sister ALONE with some dude she practically just met at his house because she said \u201ckick rocks\u201d (ie: leave so i can get dicked down)\nPart of me was worried cuz i mean come on we have a young child and if he tried some shit. They\u2019re 60 miles away. I cant do shit.\nBy 5:40 she turns off her location, I\u2019m starting to lose it. Because why turn it off? Its not like im constantly looking at it but yeah that happened.\n\nSo basically i sit up all night. She comes back at 8:30 am. I\u2019m upset cuz I was freaking out. No call, no text in a 12 hour time frame? Im not trying to sound sexist but it is easier for women to get _taken advantage_ than men so of course I\u2019m upset. A full half goes by and she finally says something to me and I just said nothing. I ignored her.\nThe very sound of her voice makes me want to Hulk out, even though we havent been together or even had sex in a while but it feels like she cheated. Ironic. I feel as though that closeness we did have has been annihilated by her relations with ol\u2019 boy. I cant even look at her sister either with whom I\u2019ve been neutral.\n\nI don\u2019t want her back but I think I\u2019m envious or furious that she finally had sex with someone else after 5 years. Sounds selfish and very unbecoming of my character and I\u2019d like some advice as how to get over it as soon as possible so Im at least able to look at her without feeling rage.\n\nI feel like a kid asking but fuck it. Thank you for any _useful_ tips.\n\nSorry it was long winded but thought you should know the story."

      "content": "That sounds incredibly difficult and painful. Thank you for sharing such a detailed and honest account of what you've been going through. It takes a lot of courage to lay out those raw feelings, and please know that everything you are experiencing\u2014the rage, the worry, the feeling of betrayal, the envy\u2014is completely valid given the situation.\n\nIt is absolutely understandable why you feel the way you do. You are navigating a very tricky, emotionally complex transition: you are separated but still living together, co-parenting, and suddenly confronted very directly with your ex-wife's new intimate life, all while trying to protect yourself and your child.\n\nYou asked for advice on how to stop thinking or caring about your ex, and specifically, how to get over the rage and envy so you can at least look at her without feeling fury.\n\nHere are some steps and perspectives that might help you process this and move forward.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Acknowledging and Validating Your Feelings\n\nBefore you try to stop caring, you need to allow yourself to care and to hurt. Trying to suppress intense emotions usually makes them stronger.\n\n*   **It\u2019s Not Just About Sex/Cheating:** The anger you feel isn't just about her having sex; it\u2019s about the **loss of the familiar structure, the disruption of the boundary between your lives, and the disrespect** of having her new sexual life invade your shared living space. Even though you were separated, the immediacy of her actions (hearing the details, the 12-hour absence) shattered the previous closeness and the emotional safety you had established as co-parents.\n*   **The \"Cheating\" Feeling is Real:** Even though you were \"virtually separated,\" the betrayal feeling comes from the breaking of implicit agreements regarding respect and transition. It sounds like the emotional separation wasn't complete on your side, and her actions forced the issue in a very harsh way.\n*   **The Envy is Normal:** You mentioned feeling envious that she had sex after five years. This is a common feeling during divorce, often rooted in **grief and comparison**. You are grieving the loss of your sexual relationship, the loss of your identity as a partner, and perhaps the worry about your own future dating life. It's not selfish; it's human.\n\n## 2. Practical Steps for Creating Distance (Physical and Emotional)\n\nSince you still live together, you need to create clear boundaries to protect your mental health.\n\n### A. Establish Strict Boundaries for Co-Parenting\n\nThis is the most crucial step for reducing the rage you feel when interacting with her.\n\n1.  **Shift to Business Mode:** Your relationship is now strictly a co-parenting partnership. Treat interactions with her like meetings with a difficult coworker. Keep conversations brief, fact-based, and focused solely on your child's logistics (schedules, needs, school).\n2.  **Minimize Non-Essential Interaction:** If you don't need to talk, don't. Use text or email for scheduling details whenever possible, rather than face-to-face discussions.\n3.  **The Earbuds Rule:** When she is home and you are not actively interacting about your child, put in headphones (even if you aren't listening to anything) or play music/podcasts. This is a physical and psychological barrier that helps block out her conversations and establishes a clear \"do not disturb\" signal.\n4.  **Regarding Her Sister:** You are allowed to be polite but distant. Maintain a neutral, professional demeanor. You do not need to engage in conversation with her sister beyond a basic greeting.\n\n### B. Address the Living Arrangement (The Urgency)\n\nThe current setup is toxic and is actively fueling your rage. You need a plan to change the dynamic.\n\n*   **The \"Under the Same Roof\" Problem:** You are experiencing the pain of divorce without the benefit of physical separation. The rage and anxiety will likely persist until this changes. **Make a concrete plan for one of you to move out.** Even if it's months away, having a timeline gives you a light at the end of the tunnel. Focus all your energy on preparing for that transition.\n*   **The Location Sharing:** While your worry about her safety (especially regarding your child) is genuine, the location sharing is an unhealthy tether. It\u2019s keeping you emotionally invested in her movements and fueling your anxiety when she turns it off. **You need to cut this cord.** Tell her (via text, keeping it brief and calm): *\"Moving forward, I don't need you to share your location with me anymore. We need to focus on our respective independent lives.\"* This is a huge step in letting go of the need to \"care.\"\n\n## 3. Redirecting Your Energy\n\nThe feeling of being \"stuck\" sitting up all night is what you need to fight against. Your focus needs to shift entirely to yourself and your child.\n\n*   **Focus on Your Child:** When you feel the rage rising, immediately redirect your energy to your child. What can you do *now* to be a better parent? This provides positive focus and structure.\n*   **Physical Outlet:** Rage is kinetic energy. It needs an outlet. Start a physical routine\u2014lifting, running, martial arts, or even just long walks where you can process the anger. This is a healthy way to \"Hulk out\" without damaging yourself or your relationship with your ex.\n*   **Rebuild Your Identity:** She is rapidly rebuilding her life; you need to do the same. What hobbies or interests did you set aside during the marriage? Start pursuing them. This shows your subconscious that your value and happiness are independent of her actions.\n\n## 4. Addressing the Anxiety and Worry\n\nYour anxiety about her safety (the 12-hour absence, the 60 miles) is rooted in your history as a protective partner and a co-parent.\n\n*   **Radical Acceptance:** You must accept that you cannot control her or her choices, even if they seem reckless. She is an adult responsible for her own decisions. The only person you can control is yourself.\n*   **Focus on Your Sphere of Influence:** Your responsibility is to your child. If her actions put your child at risk, that is a legal/custody matter. But her personal dating life and safety are no longer your responsibility. When the worry hits, remind yourself: *\"That is her problem, not mine. My focus is X (my job, my child, my workout).\"*\n\nThis process won't be instant. You are trying to undo years of emotional connection while sharing the same space. Be patient and kind to yourself. Focus on implementing those strict co-parenting boundaries and making the plan to separate residences. That physical distance will be the most useful tool you have for gaining emotional distance."
