I spent the first week after a drunken event feeling so shitty about myself, I honestly thought that I would never be happy again.  My regret knew no limit.  I felt I had completely ruined my life. I had betrayed my SO, my family, her family, and all the ideals I had lived up to for my entire life.   Imagine my surprise when my mind suddenly flipped from remorse to longing for another chance with \u201cher.\u201d  I know that it won\u2019t happen.  I know that it CAN\u2019T happen.  But my brain keeps thinking of it as something desirable and possible.  And to make matters worse, she is sending me messages encouraging it.  How do I get rid of this feeling?  I\u2019m sure the \u2018right\u2019 answer is to cut her out of my life completely, but I don\u2019t even know if that is possible.  I\u2019d love to hear from other dudes who have had similar experiences (if there are any).  Thanks."

      "content": "This sounds like an incredibly painful and confusing situation to be in. Thank you for reaching out and sharing honestly about what you're going through. It takes a lot of courage to face these feelings, especially when they involve such intense regret, betrayal, and now, unexpected longing.\n\nPlease know that while I cannot offer personal experiences like those you are asking for from other men who have cheated, I can offer a supportive space to process the feelings and explore strategies that might help you manage this turmoil.\n\nIt's completely understandable that your emotions are swinging wildly right now\u2014from intense remorse and self-loathing to longing and desire. This kind of emotional whiplash is very common after a significant boundary violation and a sudden, intense connection (even if it was brief and regrettable).\n\nLet's break down what you've described and look at some potential steps based on the emotional and practical challenges you've raised.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Emotional Flip\n\nYou mentioned the shift from intense remorse to longing. This shift is often a psychological defense mechanism, but also a genuine emotional response:\n\n1.  **The Pain of Remorse:** The level of guilt you described\u2014feeling you ruined your life and betrayed everyone\u2014is immense. That level of pain is exhausting. The mind often looks for an \"out\" or a distraction from that immediate, crushing shame.\n2.  **The Allure of the Affair Partner (The \"Fantasy\"):** The affair partner often represents an escape from the pain, the problems in your primary relationship (if any), or simply the intense reality of your life. The longing you feel might not be for *her* specifically, but for the **feeling** she represents: excitement, validation, or temporary relief from your current suffering. Since the affair was a secret, it exists outside of reality and can become highly idealized by your brain.\n3.  **The Encouragement:** The fact that she is actively messaging you and encouraging contact is a massive destabilizing factor. This validates the fantasy your brain is building and makes the \"desirable and possible\" feeling much stronger.\n\n### How to Get Over the Other Woman: Practical Steps\n\nYou correctly identified the \"right answer\" as cutting her out, but you also expressed doubt about whether that is possible. Let's focus on making it possible, because until you create physical and digital distance, the emotional longing will be extremely difficult to overcome.\n\n#### 1. Implement Immediate and Total No Contact (The Hard Stop)\n\nThis is the most critical step, especially since she is actively messaging you. Every message she sends is like pouring gasoline on the fire of your longing.\n\n*   **Block Her Everywhere:** This means phone number, social media (even if you just block her from viewing your profile), email, and any messaging apps (WhatsApp, etc.).\n*   **Do Not Explain:** Do not send a final message explaining that you are cutting her off. That invites a response and a negotiation. Simply block and delete the threads. This is not about being rude; it is about self-preservation and respecting your commitment to your SO (whether you stay together or not).\n*   **Acknowledge the Difficulty:** It will feel impossible, and you will likely feel withdrawal symptoms (anxiety, obsessiveness, desire to check if she's tried to reach out). Treat this like breaking an addiction. The first 72 hours are the worst, and the first few weeks are a constant battle.\n\n#### 2. Re-establish Your \"Why\"\n\nWhen the longing hits, you need a powerful counter-thought.\n\n*   **Focus on Consequences, Not Feelings:** Your brain is focusing on the \"desirable\" feeling. You need to force it to focus on the **consequences** and the **betrayal**. Write down why this cannot happen (betrayal of your SO, potential destruction of your life/family, loss of self-respect). Read this list whenever you feel the urge to contact her.\n*   **Remind Yourself of the \"Shitty\" Feeling:** Recall the intense, crushing regret you felt in the first week. That feeling is the true cost of pursuing this. Your brain is trying to trick you into forgetting that pain.\n\n#### 3. Shift Your Focus Back to the Core Problem\n\nThe affair was a symptom, not the root cause. You need to focus on the future of your primary relationship (or the future of your own integrity if the relationship ends).\n\n*   **Focus on Reconciliation (If Applicable):** If you are trying to reconcile with your SO, every ounce of energy must go into that process. This means radical transparency, therapy, and focusing on *her* pain, not your longing.\n*   **Focus on Self-Work:** If you are not reconciling, you need to dedicate this energy to understanding why you crossed that boundary. This is often best done with a professional therapist who specializes in infidelity or behavioral issues.\n\n#### 4. Manage the Obsessive Thoughts\n\nThe thoughts about her being \"desirable and possible\" are intrusive and powerful.\n\n*   **Acknowledge, Don't Engage:** When the thought pops up, label it: \"That is a fantasy thought about [her name/the affair].\" Do not argue with it or explore the fantasy. Simply acknowledge it and redirect your attention immediately to a task (work, exercise, writing, a chore).\n*   **Use the 10-Minute Rule:** If you are overwhelmed with the desire to contact her or dwell on the memories, tell yourself you can think about it or act on it in 10 minutes. Then, use those 10 minutes to distract yourself completely. Usually, the intensity of the urge will subside slightly.\n\n### Seeking Professional Support\n\nYou are dealing with immense emotional complexity, guilt, and the difficulty of breaking an emotional tie that is being actively encouraged. This is often too much to handle alone.\n\n*   **Individual Therapy:** A therapist can help you navigate the guilt, understand the root causes of the cheating, and provide concrete strategies for managing the intrusive thoughts and the practical steps of going \"No Contact.\"\n*   **Support Groups:** While I cannot provide specific groups, seeking out men's groups focused on integrity, recovery, or dealing with the aftermath of infidelity can provide the peer experience you are looking for. Hearing how others managed the withdrawal and rebuilding process can be invaluable.\n\nYou are in a tunnel right now, and it feels like the longing is the only light, but it\u2019s a false light that leads back to the pain you felt initially. Cutting off the source of encouragement (her messages) is the necessary first step toward regaining control and clarity.\n\nHow do you feel about the idea of implementing a total, immediate block, even though it feels challenging?"
