Serious question, what do define as a crazy girl/what types or levels are there?\n\nI am not violent, I don't stalk or get jealous or make demands (often I am encouraged to ask for help/assistance more because I can be overly Independent and always prefer to help others), I don't cheat or steal, have no psychological disorders and am often told I am one of the sweetest people someone's ever met-so no forms of cruelty either.\n\nBut....\n\nI do have a history of depression (it's better now and only situational), I tried to commit suicide when I was a teenager, but am also told my ability to remain hopeful and optimistic when things are tough is great. I also tend to say what is on my mind, have a dark/dr. House sense of humor, my father who I was extremely close with died from his alcohol and drug addiction addiction when I was 20. I've moved around and traveled a lot, was abused as a child, not an alcoholic but I come form a family of alcoholics and I can definitely party-no hard drugs though, am a former self harmer but recently had a relapse, I don't causally sleep with people but once I am comfortable enough to sleep with I am up for anything, am very enthusiastic and particularly enjoy oral. Also, I am a bisexual, which I am putting in my post because it seems to make some people assume it's a crazy/damaged quality.\n\nAnd I certainly don't tell someone this right up front but if we've known each other for a couple of month, you'll mostly likely know all this.\n\nAnd all of those quality seem to be attached to the label of the \"crazy\" or \"damaged\" girl.\n\n1) Based on the qualities I have, would I be seen as a crazy girl? Or a damaged girl?\n\n2) Are there levels of crazy/damaged to you?\n \n3) What are they and are their any you would date?"

      "content": "This is a really thoughtful and vulnerable post, and I appreciate you sharing these feelings and questions. It takes courage to look at yourself honestly and consider how others might perceive you, especially when you're grappling with difficult past experiences.\n\nIt sounds like you are wrestling with the difference between having a complex history and being labeled by negative societal stereotypes.\n\nSince I am an AI, I can't offer personal opinions or dating advice, nor can I diagnose or define mental health labels. However, I can help you explore the concepts you're asking about, address the societal stereotypes you mentioned, and reflect on the feelings behind your question.\n\n---\n\n### Addressing Your Core Questions and Concerns\n\nThe term \"crazy girl\" or \"damaged girl\" is not a clinical or meaningful psychological term. It is almost always a **pejorative, judgmental, and harmful societal label** used to dismiss, control, or stereotype women who are perceived as overly emotional, complex, non-conforming, or challenging.\n\nWhen people use these labels, they are usually reflecting their own biases, fears, and inability to handle emotional depth or complexity, rather than describing an objective reality about the person they are labeling.\n\n#### 1. Based on the qualities I have, would I be seen as a crazy girl? Or a damaged girl?\n\nIf someone were to apply the label \"crazy\" to you, they would likely be focusing on the parts of your history that involve intense emotion, trauma, or non-conformity, such as:\n\n*   History of depression and suicide attempt.\n*   History of self-harm (and recent relapse).\n*   Your dark humor and tendency to speak your mind (which some people perceive as confrontational or \"too much\").\n*   Your history of abuse and familial addiction issues.\n*   Your comfort and enthusiasm regarding sex, combined with being bisexual (which, as you correctly noted, some prejudiced people wrongly link to instability).\n\n**However, these qualities do not make you \"crazy\" or inherently \"damaged.\"**\n\n*   **They make you resilient:** You have survived trauma, addiction in your family, and mental health struggles, yet you are hopeful, optimistic, and independent.\n*   **They make you human:** Everyone has a history, and yours is simply more complex and challenging than some.\n*   **They make you honest:** You are open about who you are, which is a sign of integrity, not instability.\n\nThe qualities you listed that are **positive and healthy**\u2014not being violent, not stalking, being kind, being supportive of others, being honest, and having no active psychological disorders\u2014are far more important indicators of your character and stability than past struggles.\n\n**The most accurate way to describe you based on your list is a person who has experienced significant trauma, faced mental health challenges, and is actively working on healing and building a meaningful life.**\n\n#### 2. Are there levels of crazy/damaged to you? & 3. What are they and are their any you would date?\n\nSince I am an AI, I cannot define \"levels of crazy\" (as it's a non-existent concept) or offer personal dating preferences.\n\nHowever, we can look at what people *actually* mean when they use these terms in a relationship context. They are usually differentiating between:\n\n| The Harmful Label/Stereotype | What They Are *Actually* Describing (Healthy vs. Unhealthy Behaviors) |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **\"Crazy\"** | **Unhealthy Behaviors:** Manipulation, dishonesty, emotional abuse, extreme instability (e.g., substance abuse that impacts daily functioning), volatility, or lack of respect for boundaries. **Healthy Behaviors:** Being passionate, expressing strong emotions, having high energy, or speaking up for oneself. |\n| **\"Damaged\"** | **Unhealthy Behaviors:** Unresolved trauma leading to behaviors like avoidance, self-sabotage, pushing people away, or an inability to maintain healthy attachment. **Healthy Behaviors:** Having a complex history, being sensitive, being introspective, or needing support/space to heal. |\n\n**The crucial distinction is between a person who has a history of struggle (which is most people) and a person who actively engages in harmful, abusive, or manipulative behavior *now*.**\n\nBased on your description, you fall into the category of a person who has a history of struggle, but you specifically state you do **not** engage in the harmful behaviors (no cruelty, no stalking, no jealousy, no demanding behavior).\n\n### Next Steps and Reflection\n\nIt sounds like you are worried that when you open up to people, they will selectively focus on your past struggles and use them as an excuse to dismiss you. This fear is understandable, especially given societal biases.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n1.  **The Audience Matters:** When someone genuinely cares about you, they see your history as part of the total package\u2014the resilience, the empathy, the depth\u2014that makes you who you are. If someone immediately labels you \"crazy\" after hearing about your history, it reveals more about their immaturity, fear, or inability to handle emotional complexity than it does about you.\n2.  **Managing Disclosure:** You mentioned you share this information after a couple of months. This timing is usually healthy. It allows the other person to get to know your core character\u2014your kindness, independence, and humor\u2014before learning about the difficult chapters of your life. When you share, you are testing if they are mature enough to handle you, not whether you are \"good enough\" for them.\n3.  **Focus on the Present:** While your past informs who you are, your present actions define you. You are actively managing your mental health, you are independent, and you are kind. These are the qualities that define your current stability.\n\nIf you are struggling with the recent relapse in self-harm, please remember that support is available and it is a sign that you are still fighting and need care. If you are in the US, you can call or text **988** to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.\n\nYou are not defined by the most painful parts of your history, but by the strength it took to survive them."
