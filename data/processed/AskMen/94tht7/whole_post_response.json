      "content": "How do you deal with Erectile Dysfunction at a young age?\n\nMy girlfriend and I found out she was pregnant in the middle of July. We\u2019ve always had an amazing sex life and I\u2019ve never had any issues maintaining an erection when with her. Recently she went to the beach on vacation for 5 days. While she was gone I masturbated a lot and stressed out about stuff at home involving her and her pregnancy, our apartment, etc. The first night she got back, I couldn\u2019t get an erection. Since then, we\u2019ve had sex a few times and about half the time I can\u2019t get hard or hold the erection. I keep thinking back to that first night with problems. Am I screwed and is this the future of our relationship?? Should I talk to a mental health professional? I\u2019m really freaking out. Thanks for any advice."

      "content": "This sounds like a very stressful and upsetting situation, and it's completely understandable that you are \"really freaking out.\" First, I want to emphasize that **what you are experiencing is common, especially during periods of high stress and major life changes.**\n\nPlease take a deep breath. You are absolutely **not \"screwed,\" and this is very unlikely to be the permanent future of your relationship.**\n\nHere is a breakdown of what might be happening and how you can approach this, focusing on immediate steps and long-term support.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding What Is Likely Happening\n\nBased on your description, the most probable cause of your recent difficulties is **Performance Anxiety** triggered by a period of intense stress and worry.\n\n### The Cycle of Performance Anxiety:\n\n1.  **The Trigger:** Your girlfriend was away, you were masturbating frequently, and you were intensely stressed about the pregnancy, the apartment, and the future. Stress is a massive physical and mental barrier to arousal.\n2.  **The First Failure:** That first night back, your body was still full of stress hormones (like adrenaline), which restrict blood flow\u2014the opposite of what you need for an erection. You couldn't get hard.\n3.  **The Mental Trap:** That single instance of difficulty became a huge focus. Now, every time you try to be intimate, your brain immediately flashes back to the failure, asking, \"Will it happen again?\"\n4.  **The Outcome:** This worry triggers the **fight-or-flight response** (stress/anxiety), which actively prevents an erection. This confirms your fear, making the anxiety worse the next time.\n\nThis is a classic feedback loop. The problem is likely not physical, but **psychological and situational.**\n\n## 2. Immediate Steps You Can Take\n\n### A. Reduce the Pressure (The Most Important Step)\n\nThe pressure to \"perform\" is your biggest enemy right now. You need to temporarily remove that pressure.\n\n*   **Communicate with Your Girlfriend:** This is crucial. Tell her, honestly and calmly, exactly what you told me: \"I have been under an immense amount of stress lately, specifically about the pregnancy and the apartment. I think this stress has led to some performance anxiety, and I need us to take the pressure off sex for a little while.\"\n*   **Take Intercourse Off the Table:** For the next week or two, agree that you will not try to have penetrative sex. This is not a punishment; it's a necessary reset.\n*   **Focus on Intimacy, Not Performance:** Re-engage sexually in ways that don't require an erection. Focus on kissing, cuddling, massage, oral sex (giving and receiving), and mutual pleasure. This reminds your body and mind that intimacy is about connection, not just function. When you remove the pressure, erections often return naturally and spontaneously.\n\n### B. Manage Your Stress\n\nYou mentioned stressing about the pregnancy and the apartment. These are massive stressors that are impacting your physiology.\n\n*   **Schedule Worry Time:** Instead of letting the worries consume you all day, designate 15 minutes each evening to sit down and write out all your fears and potential solutions. Then, put them away.\n*   **Physical Stress Relief:** Make time for exercise (even a 20-minute walk), deep breathing exercises, or meditation. Physical activity helps burn off the stress hormones that are clogging your system.\n\n## 3. Should You Talk to a Professional?\n\n**Yes, absolutely.** Talking to a professional is not a sign that you are \"screwed\"; it is a sign that you are being proactive and taking charge of your health and relationship.\n\n### A. Start with a Doctor (Urologist or Primary Care Physician)\n\nIt is always wise to rule out any underlying physical causes, even if the anxiety is the most likely culprit.\n\n*   **What they will do:** They can check your blood pressure, cholesterol, and possibly your hormone levels (like testosterone).\n*   **Why this helps:** If they confirm everything is physically fine, it provides massive reassurance that the issue is psychological, which can instantly reduce your anxiety.\n\n### B. Seek Mental Health Support\n\nA **Sex Therapist** or a **Cognitive Behavioral Therapist (CBT)** specializing in anxiety is often the best next step.\n\n*   **Why a Sex Therapist helps:** They are experts in treating performance anxiety. They can guide you through specific exercises (like the \"Sensate Focus\" technique) designed to break the anxiety cycle and help you reconnect with pleasure without the pressure of erection maintenance.\n*   **Why a CBT Therapist helps:** They can teach you techniques to challenge those catastrophic thoughts (\"Am I screwed?\" \"Is this the future?\"), manage the overall stress of the pregnancy, and prevent the anxiety from hijacking your sexual response.\n\n**In summary:** What you are dealing with is incredibly common\u2014especially for young men under stress during major life transitions like pregnancy. The fact that you had a healthy sex life before this indicates a high likelihood that this is a temporary, psychologically induced issue.\n\n**Your next steps should be:** Communicate openly with your girlfriend, temporarily remove the pressure of intercourse, and schedule appointments with a doctor and a therapist. You are doing the right thing by seeking advice."
