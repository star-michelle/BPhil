      "content": "Why can't I find my masculinity?\n\nHi, I am a 39-year-old man and I feel I am still struggling to connect to my masculinity. Like most men, when I was young I wanted to grow up to become a strong man. However, throughout my life, I haven't really felt this. \n\nMy early life was difficult. My father was an alcoholic and emotionally abusive who left us when I was around 6-7 years old. He is also probably the most masculine man I have ever met (even though it's clear he has his flaws). There was no denying he was the alpha. I still have a relationship with him but only see him a few times a year.\n\nThen, on the other hand, I was raised mostly by my over-protective and fearful mother with my 2 sisters. I had very little male influence in my life growing up. Except for my uncle who came into my life as I was around 9 years old. But he was also toxic and developed an unhealthy relationship with my older sister. He would also have crazy outbursts of anger. So I have aways grown up quite fearful of men and people in general. \n\nWhen I was young I was very shy and quiet but I managed to get through school pretty much unscathed by laying low and in my teenage years by putting on a tough guy persona even though inside I was a scared pussy. I was scared of the dark until I was into my 20's. But I understood that by acting tough most people wouldn't mess with me. When I got into my later teens I would hang around with groups who were destructive and violent and I did some stuff I am not proud of. This was until I was 21 when I messed with the wrong group and it scared me so much I withdrew completely from violence and fighting. \n\nIt was about this time I started to lift weights and started to build myself up. I thought being big and jacked would make me a man. I spent about 10 years lifting and getting big but I still didn't connect to that sense of masculinity I have been seeking my whole life. Most of my life I have been promiscuous with women but have always struggled to attract high-value women. Over the last few years, I have even started to question my sexuality even though I have never found men sexually attractive. This has also caused me a lot of distress.\n\nI do also struggle to connect with other men. I can get along fine with 'beta' males. But anytime I am around a strong alpha male, I just feel fearful and struggle to be myself. I have linked this back to my early life experiences but also because I haven't been able to connect to the masculinity within myself. It's almost as though I am scared of my power and so I feel scared around other men who express their power.\n\nOn a positive note over the last 4-5 months, I have done a lot of good work on myself, I still enjoy working out but its more about the mental benefits for me now. I am quite disciplined in life and do activities that challenge me. So over these last few months, I have noticed a gradual improvement in my life. But I have come to realize that real change is slow. \n\nI do wonder if I will ever feel like a 'man' or if this sense of masculinity is even inherent within me? Or am I searching for something I will never find? Is my nature naturally more soft and feminine? Should I just accept this? Or is it a byproduct of overprotective mothering? \n\nI'm sure I am not the only one in this position. Just wondered if anyone had any advice. (My first time posting btw)\n\nThanks for reading"

      "content": "This is a incredibly powerful and honest post. Thank you for taking the risk to share such a complex and deeply personal history. It takes real courage to articulate these struggles, especially when they are tied to core identity and early trauma.\n\nPlease know that you are absolutely not alone in this experience. What you are describing\u2014the search for authentic selfhood when early role models were either absent, toxic, or fear-inducing\u2014is a journey many men undertake, particularly in midlife.\n\nLet\u2019s break down some of the key elements you\u2019ve shared, as they offer profound insights into why you are struggling to find a definition of masculinity that feels authentic to you.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Deconstructing the Conflict: The Two Masculine Models\n\nYour history has presented you with two deeply flawed, yet powerful, models of manhood, creating a central conflict:\n\n### A. The Alpha Trauma Model (Father/Uncle)\nYou define your father as the \"most masculine man you have ever met,\" despite his alcoholism and abuse. Your uncle was similarly defined by toxic power and anger.\n\n*   **The Lesson Learned:** For you, true, undeniable masculinity was initially equated with **dominance, aggression, fear, and emotional unavailability.**\n*   **The Result:** You attempted to replicate this model (the \"tough guy persona,\" joining violent groups, getting \"jacked\"). When this failed to bring internal peace, it\u2019s because you were chasing a definition of power that is inherently destructive and empty. You are not meant to be him, and your inner self knows that.\n\n### B. The Absence/Fear Model (Mother/Sisters)\nYou were raised in an environment that was safe but fearful and overprotective, with little positive male influence.\n\n*   **The Lesson Learned:** Masculinity is either absent, or it is something to be feared and managed.\n*   **The Result:** This environment likely reinforced the idea that expressing your inherent power or assertiveness was dangerous or inappropriate. Your natural inclination is to shrink or withdraw, which conflicts with the cultural ideal of \"strength.\"\n\n**The Core Struggle:** You are simultaneously terrified of becoming the toxic men from your past, and terrified of *not* being a man at all if you don't embody their definition of strength.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Addressing Your Specific Questions and Concerns\n\n### The Fear of Power (In Others and Yourself)\n\n> \"anytime I am around a strong alpha male, I just feel fearful and struggle to be myself... It's almost as though I am scared of my power and so I feel scared around other men who express their power.\"\n\nThis is the key insight, and it makes perfect sense. If the only men who expressed \"power\" in your formative years used it to hurt others (your father, your uncle, the violent groups), then power itself becomes synonymous with danger and trauma.\n\nYou are afraid of your own power because you fear that if you access it, you will lose control and become the destructive figure you hated and feared as a child. This fear keeps you locked in a cycle of avoidance.\n\n### The Questioning of Sexuality\n\nThis is a common manifestation of identity distress, especially for men who feel they are failing to meet a perceived standard of masculinity.\n\n*   **It\u2019s often not about attraction; it\u2019s about validation.** If you feel inadequate as a man (by your old, toxic standard), your brain starts looking for reasons why. \"If I can't attract high-value women, and I don't feel like a man, maybe I'm not straight?\"\n*   It sounds like this is anxiety attempting to find an explanation for your internal discomfort. If you have no actual sexual attraction to men, focus on resolving the underlying identity conflict first.\n\n### The Search for the Internal Feeling\n\n> \"I spent about 10 years lifting and getting big but I still didn't connect to that sense of masculinity I have been seeking my whole life.\"\n\nThis is because **masculinity is not a costume; it is an internal operating system.** Physical size, aggression, and promiscuity are all external performances. They hide the scared boy inside, but they don't heal him.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Reframing Masculinity: You Are Already Doing the Work\n\nYou ask: \"Is my nature naturally more soft and feminine? Should I just accept this?\"\n\nThe answer is that *all* humans possess a blend of qualities often labeled masculine and feminine. But look at the positive work you are doing right now:\n\n*   **Discipline:** You are disciplined in life.\n*   **Challenge:** You seek activities that challenge you.\n*   **Self-Reflection:** You are doing \"good work on myself\" and prioritizing mental benefits.\n*   **Integrity:** You withdrew from violence because it violated your internal sense of right and wrong.\n\nThese traits\u2014**Discipline, Integrity, Courage (to face your past), and Responsibility (for your actions and well-being)**\u2014are the hallmarks of mature, healthy masculinity.\n\nYou are searching for a sense of \"manhood\" defined by your trauma, but the true, healthy version of masculinity is already emerging through your recent efforts. You just haven't given it that label yet.\n\n## Advice and Next Steps\n\nYou are on the right path, but you need to consciously shift the definition of what you are building.\n\n### 1. Embrace the \"Good Man\" Over the \"Alpha\"\n\nStop trying to find the \"alpha\" you. Start focusing on cultivating the **Good Man.**\n\n*   **Action:** When you feel inadequate, ask yourself: *Is this action courageous? Is it disciplined? Is it responsible? Does it align with my integrity?*\n*   **Example:** Being able to clearly communicate a boundary is far more masculine (courageous and responsible) than being able to win a fight.\n*   **Your Discipline is Your Power:** Recognize that your commitment to working out and self-improvement is a powerful act of will. This is true strength\u2014the ability to control yourself, not others.\n\n### 2. Seek Positive Male Mentorship and Connection\n\nYour fear of \"alpha\" males is understandable, but you need to find men who embody healthy power.\n\n*   **Look for Mentors:** Look for men who are powerful not because they are loud or aggressive, but because they are **calm, competent, generous, and secure.** These are the men who have integrated their power without becoming toxic.\n*   **Find a Group:** Consider joining a men's group (online or in person) focused on emotional development, shared challenges, or even a highly disciplined hobby (like martial arts, where respect and control are paramount). This allows you to practice being yourself around other men in a safe container.\n\n### 3. Address the Trauma Directly\n\nThe fear of other men, and the fear of your own power, is rooted in the trauma inflicted by your father and uncle.\n\n*   **Therapy Consideration:** If you haven't already, working with a therapist (especially one familiar with trauma and attachment theory) can be invaluable. You need to process the pain of your past so that you can separate your father\u2019s toxic version of masculinity from your own potential. You need to mourn the healthy male role model you never had.\n\n### 4. Practice Assertiveness, Not Aggression\n\nYou are scared of your power, so practice using it constructively.\n\n*   **Start Small:** Practice asserting your needs and opinions calmly in low-stakes situations. This builds confidence that your power can be expressed without causing chaos or harm. Every time you speak your truth without resorting to anger or withdrawal, you are building a new, healthy foundation of masculinity.\n\nReal change is indeed slow, but you have already made significant progress by identifying the core issues and dedicating yourself to disciplined self-work. You are not searching for something you will never find; you are searching for a definition that was stolen from you early on.\n\nKeep trusting the gradual improvements. The man you want to be is already emerging through your dedication and integrity."
