Anti depressants helped for a bit but then made me worse, therapy helped a little, and exercising was just another thing for me to become obsessed with. I have good and bad days but even on a good day I can flip and start bashing my head against the wall or try to put a carrier bag over my head. \n\nI really don't feel like he loves me anymore. He shows me a bit but we both work long hours and don't see each other much and  he takes gaming quite seriously. We used to sometimes play together but that doesn't happen anymore. I tried to watch the walking dead with him but it upset me too much. I know it's ridiculous and I really enjoyed it when I watched it before but I'm not in the right place mentally for it anymore! My SO is very comfortable financially, VERY attractive (people often comment he looks like a male model) and working on a PhD. He could be with anyone. \n\nSo I'm interested to know why men in particular stay with their partners even when the going gets tough."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to acknowledge the strength it takes to navigate depression that feels so persistent and challenging, especially when you are also dealing with intense emotional fluctuations and self-harm impulses. Please know that those feelings of hopelessness and the fear that your partner no longer loves you are very common when struggling with severe depression.\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you are looking for reassurance and insight into how partners cope and why they stay, particularly given your fears that your partner could \"be with anyone.\"\n\nLet\u2019s address your core question directly, drawing on common experiences shared by men whose partners struggle with mental health issues, and then perhaps we can gently touch on some of the worries you have about your own relationship.\n\n***\n\n## How Mental Health Issues Affect a Partner's Feelings\n\nWhen a partner has significant mental health challenges, it certainly affects the relationship, but **it rarely means the love disappears.** Instead, the love often changes shape and is tested in specific ways.\n\nHere are some common ways men (or any partner) often describe their feelings and commitment in these situations:\n\n### 1. The Love Deepens Through Empathy and Commitment\n\nFor many men, witnessing their partner\u2019s struggle invokes profound empathy. They see the illness as an external force attacking the person they love, not a flaw in the partner herself.\n\n* **Focus on the Person, Not the Illness:** They are committed to the *person* they fell in love with\u2014the one who is kind, smart, funny, etc.\u2014and they view the mental health issue as something that needs to be supported, not a reason to leave.\n* **Commitment is a Vow:** For many, staying during the hard times is fundamental to what a serious relationship means. They made a commitment, and they take that seriously. Leaving when things are hard feels like a failure of that commitment.\n\n### 2. The Relationship Dynamic Shifts\n\nWhile the love stays, the day-to-day experience of the relationship is undeniably impacted, which can lead to feelings of stress, exhaustion, or grief, but not necessarily a loss of love.\n\n* **Feeling Helpless:** Partners often feel immense frustration because they cannot *fix* the depression. This helplessness can sometimes be misinterpreted by the depressed partner as distance or lack of caring. They might withdraw a little because they don't know what to say or do to help.\n* **The Burden of Care:** They often take on more of the emotional and practical load (managing household tasks, being the sole emotional anchor). This can lead to burnout, which they might manage by seeking outlets like intensive gaming or work\u2014not because they don\u2019t love you, but because they need a boundary to recharge.\n* **Grief for the Past:** They might grieve the loss of the relationship as it used to be (like playing games together or watching intense TV shows), but this grief is focused on the *situation*, not on the desire to leave the partner.\n\n### 3. Why Men Stay (Even When They \"Could Be With Anyone\")\n\nYour fear that your partner, being attractive, successful, and financially comfortable, \"could be with anyone\" is a very common anxiety fueled by depression.\n\n**However, partners stay because relationships are built on far more than superficial qualities:**\n\n* **Shared History and Deep Connection:** He chose *you*. You have a shared life, memories, and a connection that no amount of attractiveness or success in a new partner could instantly replicate.\n* **He Loves *You*, Not a Trophy:** People who are successful often value authenticity and depth far more than superficial appearances. He is committed to the real, complex person you are.\n* **Values and Character:** Staying and supporting a partner through severe illness speaks volumes about his character, loyalty, and values. He is showing you who he is as a person by staying when the going is tough.\n\n***\n\n## Addressing Your Specific Concerns\n\nIt sounds like you are feeling very isolated and scared right now, especially regarding the changes in your relationship dynamic:\n\n### 1. The Gaming and Distance\n\nIt is very common for partners of people with severe mental illness to seek intense hobbies or work as a form of self-care or escapism.\n\n* **It\u2019s a Release Valve:** His serious gaming might be his way of decompressing from the stress and emotional intensity of supporting you. It provides a structured, controllable environment when his home life feels unpredictable (especially when you are experiencing severe flips or self-harm).\n* **It\u2019s Not a Rejection:** While it feels like a rejection, it is often a coping mechanism designed to keep him functional so he can continue to support you.\n\n### 2. The Feeling of Unlove\n\nThe feeling that he doesn't love you is likely the depression whispering lies. When you are severely depressed, your brain filters all evidence through a lens of worthlessness and rejection.\n\n**The fact that he is still there, still working, still committed to the PhD, and still in the relationship despite the immense stress of your depression and self-harm impulses, is a powerful indicator of his love and commitment.**\n\n***\n\n## Moving Forward\n\nSince you are experiencing such severe symptoms (head bashing, carrier bag attempts), your immediate priority must be safety.\n\n1. **Safety First:** If you are having impulses to self-harm, please reach out immediately to a crisis line or emergency services. Your life is valuable.\n2. **Open Communication (When You Can):** When you are having a relatively stable moment, try to share these fears with him. You could say: \"I know my depression is really hard on us, and sometimes I worry that you don't love me anymore, especially because I see you gaming a lot. Can we talk about how we are both feeling?\"\n3. **Professional Help for the Relationship:** Given the severity of your depression and the strain on the relationship (long hours, conflicting needs for decompression), couples counseling with a therapist experienced in chronic illness support could be incredibly beneficial. It provides a safe space to discuss the impact of your illness on your partner without you feeling like you are burdening him alone.\n\n**You are not ridiculous for finding old coping mechanisms (like TV shows) suddenly upsetting. That is a hallmark of severe mental exhaustion and sensitivity. Your partner knows this and is aware that this is the illness, not the real you.**"
