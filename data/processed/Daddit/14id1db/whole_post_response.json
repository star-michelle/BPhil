I watch his new wife have her first dance with her dad and just completely fucking broke down. I\u2019ll never get a fucking first Dance, hell, my dad didn\u2019t even make it to my 21st. Im so fucking sad I\u2019m so fucking angry I just want to swallow all the pills I have and die. I don\u2019t know why I won\u2019t, I\u2019m afraid of failing and waking up in a hospital somewhere. If \u201cheaven\u201d (I think it\u2019s fucking bullshit, personally) is so amazing, then why can\u2019t I join my dad up there?\n\nWhile my cousin got married and watched his wife have her first dance with her dad, I just doubled over the box of ashes I know as \u201cdad.\u201d\n\nI can\u2019t do this anymore. I\u2019m sobbing in my bed, I\u2019ve already fought with my mom, she\u2019s no fucking emotional support. What did I possibly do to deserve any of this. I try my best to be a good person, and I end up without a dad after my 19th birthday. We were born the same weeek. My birthday will never be the same. I just want to die."
