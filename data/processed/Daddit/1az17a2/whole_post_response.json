I'm actually sorry to burden you with my negative relationship issues but I really appreciate the support and feedback that I get here. You can look at my post history for more background info. I'll try to focus on my main issue to avoid making this too long. \n\nI've been with my wife for 2.5 years now. We fell in love and got serious quickly. However she also got more and more controlling but I didn't realize the extent of the issue. She often gets angry, yells, and sometimes make threats when I disagree with her. Because of that, we usually arnt able to resolve disagreements calmly without hurt feelings. \n\nWe fight very often, recently it's just her getting angry at me. She's done a few things now that have violated my boundaries and our relationship such as making major family decisions without adequate consultation and making threats about our relationship. I'm not saying I've done nothing wrong but I feel that the magnitude of our wrongs are very different. \n\nI regrettably haven't been able to bond with our son. It's partly my fault but I put a lot of blame on her for not supporting our father-son relationship. She criticizes me unfairly and takes him out of my arms whenever he starts crying. I wasn't even allowed to take him to a nearby park to meet my mother whom she doesn't like. \n\nI've been asking for marriage counselling for over 4 months now. She's agreed but keeps delaying with different excuses. I've been going to individual counselling in the meanwhile. Now after our last fight, she says she wants a 'break' where we don't discuss our relationship issues or child care differences for 3 months and that she is not willing to go to relationship counselling.\n\nI've only managed to last this long in the hopes of repairing our relationship and to avoid abandoning her. However, this refusal to attend counselling is unacceptable to me. I'm preparing to leave in a couple days. I feel guilty about leaving my son but my in-laws are living with us so my wife and son will be well supported. I will also continue to support by doing things that they might struggle with. \n\nI don't have anything specific to ask of you but I would like feedback anyways. Thank you very much for all of your support up until now. \n"

      "content": "This is a really tough situation, and it sounds like you are carrying a huge emotional burden right now. Please don't apologize for reaching out; that's what support is for. It takes immense strength to face these issues, especially with a 7-month-old at home.\n\nI hear you saying that you are at your breaking point, and that your wife's refusal to commit to counseling feels like the final unacceptable barrier.\n\nBefore we discuss next steps, I want to acknowledge how much you have already done:\n\n1.  **You recognized the core problem:** The controlling behavior, anger, yelling, and lack of calm resolution.\n2.  **You sought help:** You are already attending **individual counseling**, which is crucial for clarity and support.\n3.  **You tried to initiate change:** You repeatedly asked for marriage counseling over four months.\n4.  **You are thinking about your son's well-being:** You've factored in the support system (your in-laws) and your continued involvement.\n\nIt is completely understandable why you are preparing to leave. When one partner refuses to participate in the work necessary to fix fundamental relationship issues, it often signals the end of the road.\n\n---\n\n### Understanding the Refusal and the \"Break\"\n\nYour wife's request for a 3-month \"break\" from discussing relationship issues, coupled with the refusal to attend counseling, feels like a way to avoid accountability and maintain the status quo\u2014the status quo that is causing you immense pain.\n\nIn healthy relationships, a request for a break is usually about cooling down to come back to the issue later. In this context, it sounds like an attempt to shut down the conversation entirely, which is a form of control and boundary violation itself.\n\n### Feedback and Things to Consider\n\nYou asked for feedback, so here are a few points based on what you\u2019ve shared, focusing on clarity, safety, and your next steps:\n\n#### 1. Prioritize Your Mental Health and Safety\n\nYou mentioned frequent yelling, anger, and threats. This is not a healthy environment for you, and while you are focused on protecting your son, you also need to protect yourself. Staying in a relationship where you are constantly walking on eggshells and being emotionally abused is damaging. Leaving is often the healthiest choice for everyone involved.\n\n#### 2. The Relationship with Your Son\n\nThis is the hardest part, and your guilt is natural.\n\n*   **Leaving is not abandoning:** You are talking about leaving the *relationship*, not your son. You explicitly state you will continue to support them and be involved.\n*   **A stable, calm father is better than an unhappy, stressed father:** If you stay in this toxic environment, you will be less emotionally available and present for your son. Establishing a healthy co-parenting relationship (even if difficult initially) where you have dedicated, peaceful time with him will ultimately be better for his long-term development than him witnessing constant conflict and tension.\n*   **Document everything related to bonding:** Continue to document every instance where she prevents bonding (criticizing, taking him away). This documentation is important for establishing a clear pattern of behavior, which may be necessary if you need to formalize a custody agreement later.\n\n#### 3. What to Discuss with Your Individual Counselor\n\nSince you are already in individual counseling, focus your next session on creating a safety plan and a detailed exit strategy. Key discussion points should be:\n\n*   **The logistics of leaving:** Where will you go? How will you communicate your decision?\n*   **Co-parenting plan:** How will you request guaranteed, structured time with your son? Since she currently controls access, this needs to be firm and clear.\n*   **Legal consultation:** Even if you plan to be amicable, consulting with a family law attorney *before* you leave can provide invaluable guidance on your rights regarding custody and assets, especially since you need to ensure continued access to your son.\n\n#### 4. The Final Conversation\n\nIf you are preparing to leave in a couple of days, you need a clear, non-negotiable message. Since she has refused counseling, you have your answer.\n\n*   **Keep it brief and firm:** \"I have tried for four months to get us into counseling because I believe our relationship is fundamentally broken and needs professional help. Your refusal to attend counseling is a clear sign that you are not willing to work on repairing this relationship. I cannot continue living this way. I am leaving the marriage.\"\n*   **Do not get pulled into a fight:** She will likely react with anger, threats, or pleas. Be prepared to disengage immediately after delivering your message. If she starts yelling, simply say, \"I am not going to discuss this while you are yelling. I will be leaving on [Date].\"\n\n### Summary\n\nYou have done everything within your power to salvage this relationship, including seeking help yourself and asking for couples counseling. Her refusal is her choice, and it gives you the clarity you need to make your choice.\n\n**Leaving is not failing.** It is choosing your well-being and, ultimately, paving the way for a more stable co-parenting relationship with your son, free from the constant conflict you are currently enduring.\n\nYou are making a difficult but necessary choice. Be kind to yourself during this transition."
