I went to the lawer this morning before work.  He said I had a good case for establishing 50/50 at least.  He said we could file for no contest since she probably won't be able to get a lawyer.  He said we could get visitation rights established within a week.  Then he told me my group legal would only cover 15% of the cost.  He told me the longer I wait, the harder it will be.  I can't even afford to drive to see him every week, let alone afford the lawer.  I had a panic attack at work,  cried in front of everyone.  I'm crying right now.  How do you guys do it?  How do some of you deal with a hole in your very soul? I'm just so scared and I don't know why."

      "content": "This sounds incredibly painful, frustrating, and overwhelming. Please take a deep breath. What you are feeling right now\u2014the fear, the panic, the exhaustion, and the profound sadness\u2014is completely understandable. You are dealing with a situation that touches the core of your life: your relationship with your child, your financial stability, and your future.\n\nIt's okay that you cried at work and that you're crying now. You are under immense stress.\n\nLet's try to break this down a little, focusing on the immediate practical steps and the emotional weight you are carrying.\n\n***\n\n### Addressing the Emotional Pain\n\nFirst, let's acknowledge the \"hole in your soul\" feeling. When something this big is at stake, it feels like an existential crisis.\n\n**What you are feeling is grief and fear.** You are grieving the loss of simplicity, the loss of financial security, and the fear of losing time with your child.\n\n*   **Be Kind to Yourself:** Stop judging your reaction. You are not weak for crying; you are a parent fighting for their child under extreme duress.\n*   **Focus on the Next 5 Minutes:** When the panic is overwhelming, don't think about the whole case. Just focus on getting a glass of water, sitting down, or taking a few deep, slow breaths. Survival mode is okay right now.\n*   **Acknowledge the Fear:** You mentioned you don't know why you are scared. You are scared because the stakes are the highest they can be, and you feel powerless because of money. That is a very rational reason to be terrified.\n\n***\n\n### Addressing the Practical Setbacks (The Lawyer/Money Issue)\n\nIt sounds like the lawyer gave you good legal news (you have a strong case) but devastating financial news (you can\u2019t afford him).\n\nWhen people ask \"How do you do it?\" often the answer is **\"You don't do it alone, and you do it in tiny pieces.\"**\n\nWe need to address the financial barrier. Since this lawyer is out of reach, we need to explore alternatives immediately.\n\n**To help me give you the most relevant information, could you clarify a few things?**\n\n1.  **What state or jurisdiction are you in?** (Custody laws are very specific to location, and this helps identify local resources.)\n2.  **What is the status of the legal action right now?** Did the lawyer file anything, or was this just a consultation?\n3.  **What is the immediate visitation situation?** Are you currently seeing your child, and if so, how often?\n\n**In the meantime, here are general steps for finding affordable legal help:**\n\n1.  **Legal Aid Societies / Pro Bono:** Immediately search for \"Legal Aid Society [Your County/State]\" or \"Pro Bono Family Law [Your County/State].\" These organizations offer free or low-cost services for people below a certain income level.\n2.  **Self-Help Centers & Clinics:** Many county courthouses have free self-help centers staffed by paralegals or volunteer attorneys who can help you fill out the initial paperwork to file for custody/visitation yourself. Since the lawyer said you could file for \"no contest,\" doing the initial filing might be manageable.\n3.  **Sliding Scale Attorneys:** Some attorneys will take cases on a limited scope basis (meaning they only help with certain steps, like reviewing documents) or charge reduced fees based on your income.\n4.  **Community Resources:** Check local women's shelters or domestic violence organizations (even if DV wasn't a factor, they often have connections to free family law resources).\n\nThe goal right now is to **get a plan for the next step that doesn't rely on the expensive lawyer.** You need to establish visitation, and that is your most urgent priority.\n\nPlease know that your feelings are valid. You are in a tough fight, but the fact that you are reaching out and looking for solutions shows incredible strength. Let's focus on finding that next affordable step."
