      "content": "\"You need to make time for yourself\"\n\nFor context, I'm a dad to a wonderful 2 year old girl and I love it. Also relevant -I have struggled with chronic depression my entire life.\n\nI have been told the titular phrase more times than I can count- by my therapist, by the fellas in my men's group, by my parents and extended family, even by my wife. \"You need to make time for yourself so you can be at your best for your daughter\". And every time someone says that to me, I get more and more frustrated. \n\nToday will mark the third session of my men's mental health group in a row that I will have to miss because my wife Is having a hard time mentally right now, and watching the kiddo from 7am-8pm straight is just not going to happen. Normally, grandma takes the kiddo on Thursdays to take pressure off mom, and so I can do the mental health work with my group that has been so helpful. Well, grandma has flaked out 4 weeks running with stupid excuses. \n\nAt this point my trust in ANYONE that says they can or will help my family out is at absolute rock bottom. \"Oh sure, we'd love to watch *daughter's name* any time!\". Yeah, sure. I've done this song and dance plenty- we'll schedule a time with you, the day will come and there's always a fucking reason why it can't happen. Our kiddo is not hard to watch- she's the best behaved 2 year old I've ever met. This is just people who you thought were reliable pretending they want to help and finding reasons not to.\n\n\nSo when should I make time for myself to take care of my mental health? My wife and daughter need me, and I'm going to be there for them. That is my job, and that is more important than anything else, even my own sanity. The next person tells me to take time for myself is  getting a hearty laugh and two middle fingers in their face. \n\nRant aside, I'm sure quite a few of you fellas have felt stuck in a situation like this- any advice or words of wisdom would definitely be appreciated, I'm kind of out of ideas at this point. Just never expected to be so disappointed by so many people so much of the time."

      "content": "Man, I hear you. That frustration is completely justified, and I want to start by saying: **You are in an impossible situation, and your anger is 100% warranted.**\n\nWhen people throw out the advice \"make time for yourself,\" they are offering a simple solution to a complex problem, and they are ignoring the logistical reality of being the primary caregiver during a crisis (your wife struggling) while simultaneously dealing with chronic depression and a completely unreliable support network.\n\nThe hearty laugh and two middle fingers? Earned.\n\nHere is what I see, and what I\u2019ve learned from watching other dads in similar positions:\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Betrayal of Unreliability\n\nThe deep disappointment you feel about people flaking is arguably the most corrosive element of your current situation. It\u2019s not just about the missed babysitting; it\u2019s about the **mental energy cost** of believing someone, planning around them, and then having to absorb the stress of their failure.\n\nWhen you\u2019re already running on empty, that feeling of being let down\u2014that absolute confirmation that you are truly alone in the trenches\u2014is devastating. It makes you protective, cynical, and rightly furious.\n\n**The only way forward with unreliable people is to stop relying on them.**\n\nIt sounds harsh, but you need to treat every offer of help from Grandma or others as a pleasant bonus if it happens, but never, ever, as a scheduled necessity. If you need that Thursday night free, you need a Plan B, C, and D that *do not* involve relying on them. Since paid help seems out of the question right now, this means the time you take must come from within the current household structure.\n\n## 2. Reframing \"Making Time\"\n\nYou are absolutely right: you cannot schedule a 90-minute therapy session or a 2-hour men's group right now. The idea that you can carve out a clean block of time is a fantasy.\n\nHowever, you still have to deal with the depression, which is a demanding passenger. You need to shift the focus from **\"Making Time\"** to **\"Stealing Minutes\"** and **\"Lowering the Bar.\"**\n\n\"Time for yourself\" doesn't have to be a spa day or a fishing trip. It can be a micro-dose of mental health maintenance.\n\n### A. The 5-Minute Wall\n\nWhen you hit the wall, you need a guaranteed 5-minute break that requires zero coordination.\n\n*   **The Bathroom Lock:** This is a classic for a reason. Tell your wife you need 5 minutes of total silence, grab your phone, and sit on the toilet (even if you don't need to go). Put on noise-canceling headphones (if you have them) and listen to 5 minutes of instrumental music or a guided breathing exercise. This is non-negotiable. It\u2019s not a full session, but it is a mental reset button.\n*   **The Car Commute:** If you drive anywhere, even to the grocery store, use that time. Pull over for an extra 3 minutes before you go inside. Listen to your favorite loud song, or just sit in silence. This is your pocket of peace.\n\n### B. The Hand-Off of Control\n\nYou are protecting your family, and that is admirable. But you stated: \"That is my job, and that is more important than anything else, even my own sanity.\"\n\nI have to gently push back on this. **Your sanity *is* part of your job.** The best thing you can do for your wife and daughter is ensure the man they rely on doesn't burn out completely.\n\nSince your wife is struggling, she may not be able to handle a large caregiving block, but she must be able to handle **one small task** that frees you up.\n\n*   **Trade-Off:** Instead of asking her to watch the kid for 2 hours, ask her to handle the kid for 20 minutes while you go do the dishes/laundry/a small chore **in silence.** You are still contributing to the household, but you\u2019ve traded the emotional demand of primary caregiving for the physical demand of a chore\u2014and you get the benefit of silence.\n\n### C. Leveraging the Men's Group (Even When Absent)\n\nMissing the group stings because you lose the connection and the ability to vent safely.\n\n*   **Text/Call a Member:** Can you designate one or two reliable guys from the group and ask them to send you a 10-minute summary text or hop on a quick call right after the meeting? Even 10 minutes of targeted connection and processing is better than total isolation.\n*   **Journal the Rant:** Your rant here was articulate, powerful, and honest. That is mental health work. When you miss the group, spend 15 minutes writing out everything you would have said\u2014the anger, the disappointment, the commitment. Get it out of your head and onto the page.\n\n## 3. The Chronic Depression Factor\n\nWhen you are already battling chronic depression, the constant stress and lack of support become triggers, not just annoyances. You are operating with a severe handicap, and the expectations placed upon you (by others and yourself) are simply unsustainable.\n\nYou are doing the work of two people right now: full-time primary caregiver and supportive partner to someone who is struggling. That is a heroic effort.\n\nBe kind to the man doing the 7 AM to 8 PM shift. You are showing up, you are prioritizing your family, and you are fighting an internal battle against depression every single day. That is incredible strength.\n\nKeep stealing those minutes. Lower the bar on what self-care looks like. And please, hold firm to the fact that you deserve relief, even if you have to fight for it in tiny, frustrating increments. You are not out of ideas; you are just out of reliable people. Focus on the things you can control, even if they are small."
