      "content": "Struggling New Dad - Possible Paternal PPD\n\nI am new to Daddit. As a new dad of just 5 days, I never even thought to look for an online community for dads before.\n\nMy wife and I just had our first baby 5 days ago, a beautiful little girl. I am extremely excited about her being in the world and have been looking forward to this for the last 9 months. My wife and I are amazingly in love with one another. We work very hard for one another and with one another. We have, what I feel like, is just about the most perfect relationship any couple could have. Adding a new player to our team just felt like the right step and we are both excited to have finally made it here.\n\nDespite all that, I feel like I am crumbling under the weight of expectations and responsibility to be the unflinching pillar of strength in our family. These expectations do not come from my wife or either of our families. They're all from me. \n\nThis is kind of a rough summary of all of the things that I'm feeling and all of the things that I don't even know what I'm feeling. I'm not very good with emotions. I don't really understand them. I don't really connect with them or through them. I do know that I am feeling a lot of something and this is the best I can really articulate them. I just feel like I'm not enough and that I'm failing or going to fail.\n\nIt's been a slow build since our baby was born. We spent 4 nights in the hospital and, while it was very overwhelming, there was a sense of comfort in the form of the nursing staff as a safety net. They were absolutely amazing! They did so much for us. We could really tell they were a group of people who absolutely love what they do. But once we left the hospital and were on our own, all that responsibility that they were helping with was now ours and it is heavy, to say the least.\n\nMy wife and I both fight with depression. Her more so than myself. She is just killing it right now, though. She's an amazing machine with our daughter and she doesn't flinch at anything. I am trying very hard to do the same and putting on a brave face but I am crumbling. I am scared I will mess something up. I am very clumsy. I'm scared of failing. Failing my wife and failing my daughter. I've always been a bit of a failure through most of my life.\n\nI consider myself to be pretty self-aware. I'm very analytical of myself. The things I do, think, say, feel (when I can figure them out). I am a bit of an over analyzer at times, even. But because of that, I can see the signs and they seem to check just about every box of post-partum depression. I didn't even know dads could have PPD until my wife mentioned it to me. She is aware of what I'm going through and is very supportive. It helps but this just isn't going away with simple recognition. \n\nI have read several posts and stories online and they all just kind of point at it going away over time, but I'm not sure if I have the mental or emotional fortitude to wait that long. It's been 5 days and every time my daughter cries, I want to as well. I get scared at every cough and sniffle or noise she makes. Especially at night. Not scared that something is wrong with her, but scared that I'm going to have to get up when I just laid down to get some rest. Scared that I won't sleep that night. Scared that the stress of all of this is going to utterly crush me.\n\nI'm not really sure exactly what I'm looking for out of this post. I flaired it as advice request but I think I may have just needed to get this off my chest. I think maybe I'm curious to see if there are others out there who are going through this, or have gone through this, also.\n\nI absolutely love my daughter. She is a tremendous joy and I wouldn't ever want to bail on her or my wife. I am excited to hold her and to take care of her every day. But I still feel like I'm drowning in all of this. Maybe that's the hardest part. Why do I love her so much but feel this way at the same time?"

      "content": "This is an incredibly brave and honest post. Thank you for taking the massive step of writing this down and sharing it, especially when you are only five days into this journey.\n\nFirst and foremost: **What you are feeling is real, it is valid, and you are absolutely not alone.**\n\nFive days is not enough time to be anything but overwhelmed. You are running on minimal sleep, your body chemistry is changing (yes, dads\u2019 hormones shift dramatically too!), and you have just experienced one of the most profound shifts a human can go through.\n\nLet\u2019s unpack some of the most critical things you\u2019ve shared.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating the Reality of Paternal Postpartum Depression (PP-PPD)\n\nYou are absolutely right. Dads can and do experience postpartum depression and anxiety. It is estimated to affect 1 in 10 fathers. The signs you described\u2014the anxiety, the fear of failure, the crushing weight of responsibility, the difficulty connecting with or articulating emotions, and the sleep anxiety\u2014are classic symptoms of PP-PPD.\n\nThe fact that you are analytical and self-aware enough to recognize these signs is a huge strength, not a weakness. You are not failing; you are experiencing a very real, biologically and environmentally triggered mental health struggle.\n\n> **Why do I love her so much but feel this way at the same time?**\n\nThis is perhaps the hardest question, and it is the key to understanding depression and anxiety. **These feelings are not a reflection of your love for your daughter or your commitment to your wife.** They are symptoms of an overwhelming mental state. Anxiety and depression distort reality; they lie to you and tell you you are failing, even when you are doing everything right. You can feel immense love and immense fear simultaneously because the emotional/chemical part of your brain is currently overstressed.\n\n## 2. Addressing the Crushing Expectations\n\nYou mentioned that the expectations come entirely from you\u2014the need to be the \"unflinching pillar of strength.\"\n\n**The most unflinching pillar of strength a family can have is one who is honest about their needs.**\n\nThe traditional definition of \"strength\" in early parenthood is counterproductive. True strength right now is:\n\n*   **Vulnerability:** Telling your wife, \"I need 30 minutes of uninterrupted sleep, I feel like I'm breaking.\"\n*   **Delegation:** Saying, \"I cannot handle the crying right now, can you try this soothing method?\"\n*   **Seeking Help:** Reaching out to a professional (which we will discuss below).\n\nYour wife sounds like an incredible partner, and she is showing immense strength by being the \"amazing machine\" right now. But remember, she is also fighting her own battle with depression, and she knows what it means to struggle. She doesn't need a flawless robot; she needs her husband, who is allowed to be human and overwhelmed.\n\n## 3. The Fear of Failure and Clumsiness\n\n> I am very clumsy. I\u2019m scared I will mess something up.\n\nEvery single new parent feels this way. The fear of dropping the baby, not knowing the difference between a hungry cry and a pain cry, or feeling like you are assembling a tiny, fragile piece of furniture incorrectly is universal.\n\nYou do not need to be a perfect parent. You need to be a **present** parent.\n\n*   **Babies are resilient.** They can handle awkward swaddles and clumsy burps.\n*   **Focus on the simple things:** When you hold her, just focus on holding her safely and securely. Skin-to-skin time (even if you just sit and hold her against your chest while you watch TV) is one of the best things you can do for both of you, and it requires no skill other than sitting still.\n*   **Lower the bar:** For the next few weeks, success is defined as: Baby is fed, baby is safe, and you got 90 minutes of sleep. That is it.\n\n## 4. Immediate, Actionable Advice (The Next 24 Hours)\n\nSince you asked for advice, here are immediate, small steps you can take to alleviate some of the pressure:\n\n### A. Prioritize Sleep, Even in Tiny Chunks\nThe anxiety you feel when your daughter cries at night is classic sleep deprivation anxiety. Lack of sleep warps your perception of stress.\n\n1.  **Institute Shifts:** If you haven't already, divide the night into guaranteed sleep blocks. For example:\n    *   Wife takes 9 PM \u2013 2 AM (you wear earplugs and sleep in a separate room if needed).\n    *   You take 2 AM \u2013 7 AM.\n    *   *The person \"off-duty\" must be completely off-duty.* This is not selfish; it is preventative care against burnout.\n\n### B. Seek Professional Support Immediately\nSince you have a history of depression, and you are checking the boxes for PPD, waiting for it to \"go away over time\" is not a safe or efficient strategy.\n\n1.  **Talk to your wife's doctor/midwife/pediatrician:** When you go for your daughter\u2019s check-up, ask them for a referral to a mental health professional who specializes in perinatal mood disorders. They often have resources specifically for fathers.\n2.  **Contact your primary care physician (PCP):** Tell them exactly what you wrote here. They can screen you for PPD and discuss options, including therapy or temporary medication to help manage the acute anxiety.\n3.  **Use existing resources:** If you have seen a therapist in the past for depression, call them *today*.\n\n### C. Find Your \"One Thing\"\nRight now, your wife is excelling at the mechanics (feeding, changing). Find one thing that is **yours** that is low-pressure.\n\n*   Maybe you are the designated swaddler.\n*   Maybe you are the one who handles all the laundry.\n*   Maybe you are the dedicated dish washer.\n\nThis gives you a feeling of control and contribution without the overwhelming pressure of being the primary caregiver 24/7.\n\nYou are in the thick of the hardest phase\u2014the initial shock and awe. You are doing a great job simply by showing up and caring enough to seek help. Please treat your mental health with the same urgency and care that you treat your daughter and wife."
