      "content": "Dad depression/anxiety after the birth\n\nHi Dad's, looking for some advice. Baby is a week old now and I've been feeling really negative thoughts (constantly worrying about SIDS). The birth was quite traumatic as she got stuck on the way out and the suction cup didn't work. Baby came out unconscious. She's come to very quickly and everything is okay now. Very alert and happy baby. Wife had to have two cuts to help with the whole process and she's healing fine now. \n\nBasically wanted to know if anyone else has felt this way after the birth and if it's normal or if I need to get some help. TYIA"

      "content": "Hi there. Thank you for reaching out and sharing what you're going through right now. It takes a lot of courage to talk about these feelings, especially during what is supposed to be a happy time.\n\nFirst, congratulations on the birth of your baby! I'm so glad to hear that she is alert and happy, and that your wife is healing well.\n\nIt sounds like you have been through an incredibly intense and frightening experience. Dealing with a traumatic birth where your baby got stuck, the suction cup didn't work, and she came out unconscious is a significant event. It's completely understandable that this experience is still affecting you.\n\nTo answer your question directly: **Yes, what you are feeling is something that many new parents, including fathers, experience after a difficult or traumatic birth, and it is absolutely worth paying attention to.**\n\n### What you are feeling is likely a combination of things:\n\n1.  **Response to Trauma:** Experiencing a near-crisis event like that can cause lingering stress, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts (like constantly worrying about SIDS). Your mind is trying to process what happened and is on high alert, trying to protect your baby from future harm.\n2.  **The \"Baby Blues\" in Dads:** While we often hear about postpartum depression and anxiety in mothers, fathers can and do experience perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) as well. The stress of the birth, lack of sleep, new responsibilities, and hormonal shifts can all contribute to feelings of anxiety, negativity, and worry.\n3.  **Normal New Parent Anxiety:** Worrying about SIDS is common for almost all new parents, but the traumatic birth experience has likely amplified this worry significantly for you.\n\n### Is it normal, or do you need help?\n\nIt is **normal** to feel intense anxiety after a traumatic event and when caring for a newborn.\n\nHowever, if these negative thoughts and worries are constant, distressing, interfering with your ability to enjoy your time with your family, or making it hard to sleep (even when the baby is sleeping), then **you absolutely should seek support.**\n\n**The benchmark for needing help isn't whether it's \"normal,\" but whether it's causing you distress.** You deserve to feel supported and well during this time.\n\n### What you can do now:\n\n1.  **Talk about the Birth:** Can you talk to your wife, a trusted friend, or family member about the details of the birth and how terrifying it was for you? Verbalizing the trauma can sometimes help reduce its power.\n2.  **Acknowledge the Fear:** Try to remind yourself that the fear you feel is a direct result of a real, scary event that happened, but that your baby is now safe and healthy.\n3.  **Prioritize Sleep (If Possible):** Sleep deprivation can dramatically worsen anxiety. Try to coordinate with your wife to ensure you both get at least one stretch of decent sleep each day.\n4.  **Connect with Other Dads:** Finding a support group or online forum specifically for new fathers can be incredibly helpful for realizing you are not alone.\n\n**I strongly encourage you to reach out to a professional.** Given the traumatic nature of the birth and the constant, negative thoughts you are having, speaking with a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma or perinatal mental health could be very beneficial.\n\n**If you are in the US or Canada, you can also call or text the Postpartum Support International (PSI) helpline at 1-800-944-4773.** They have resources and support tailored specifically for fathers.\n\nPlease keep checking in here if you need to talk more. You are doing a great job caring for your family, and taking care of yourself is part of that. How are you managing sleep right now?"
