      "content": "will the resentment go away?\n\nI always wanted to have a baby. Now i have one and the affection i felt for her faded away in two months. She cries 7/24. Not just simply crying but shrieking. Every interaction with her results in this. She screams before, during, after diaper change, before and after feeding. Only time she is not crying is when she is feeding. The total time she smiled at us in two months is maybe 30 mins in total. The rest was trashing, crying, screaming and shrieking. I visited a friend and couldnt believe that they put their 1 month old in babasling. When we tried that she had such a fit that i thought she was going to pass out. I feel guilty all the time because of this but i really want to do nothing with her since she does nothing but scream. When i take care of her its because i have to. Everything is ok with her, her mothers milk is enough etc. I am not asking for advice. I just want to learn when she hopefully gets better will the resentment go away?"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly painful and exhausting. It takes immense courage to articulate feelings like this, especially when they clash so dramatically with what you expected parenthood to be like. Please know that what you are feeling is a very real response to a profoundly stressful and unrelenting situation.\n\nYou are asking a deeply important question: **\"Will the resentment go away?\"**\n\nWhile I cannot predict the future or guarantee specific emotional outcomes, I can offer some perspective based on what is known about this experience:\n\n### 1. The Relationship Between Resentment and the Situation\n\nThe resentment you are feeling is tied directly to the current, extreme reality you are living in. You are describing a situation that is essentially chronic, high-intensity trauma: constant shrieking, zero positive reinforcement, and a complete dissonance between expectation and reality.\n\nWhen the factors driving the resentment change, the feeling itself typically changes, too.\n\n*   **When the baby gets \"better\" (meaning, when the crying significantly decreases, and positive interactions increase):** The primary source of the exhaustion, frustration, and feeling of being attacked will diminish. When that happens, the emotional guard you\u2019ve built up\u2014which is manifesting as resentment\u2014will likely begin to soften.\n*   **A Shift in Interaction:** Right now, your primary interaction is a necessity-based transaction (feeding, changing) driven by screaming. When the baby starts offering more smiles, coos, and calm periods, your interaction will shift from *duty* to *relationship*. This shift is often what allows the original affection to return.\n\n### 2. The Nature of Resentment\n\nResentment is often defined as indignation or ill will felt as a result of a real or imagined injury or offense. In your case, the injury is the loss of your expected experience, the constant assault on your senses, and the feeling that this tiny person is actively rejecting all your efforts.\n\nIt is a protective mechanism. It\u2019s your psyche\u2019s way of saying, \"I cannot sustain this level of input and stress, so I am detaching.\"\n\nAs the baby matures and the behavior improves (which usually happens as their nervous system develops and potential issues like colic resolve), the \"injury\" lessens, and the need for that protective emotional wall often fades.\n\n### 3. The Timeline of Change\n\nWhile every baby is different, many parents who experience severe, relentless crying (often categorized as severe colic or a \"high-needs\" temperament) report significant improvements around the **3 to 5 month mark**.\n\n*   For some, the resentment begins to lift immediately when the first truly calm day arrives.\n*   For others, it takes a little longer. Even when the crying stops, the feeling of emotional depletion remains for a time. But as the positive interactions (smiles, laughs, reaching out) become more frequent, they act as powerful counterweights to the memory of the trauma, gradually dissolving the resentment and allowing affection to re-emerge.\n\nWhat you are describing is survival mode. When you are no longer in survival mode, the emotional landscape changes dramatically.\n\nIt sounds like you are enduring something profoundly difficult right now, and it\u2019s understandable that you feel detached. Holding onto hope for that change is critical, and based on the typical developmental trajectory, that change is very likely to come."
