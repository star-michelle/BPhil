She would go to sleep around midnight, wake up for a bottle and diaper around 3, then again around 6. My wife and I would each take 1 shift and it worked out pretty well. Now she has decided to not sleep at all. She will lay there screaming and crying not matter what. She will be fed and have a fresh diaper but she will still cry. We have tried swaddling, sleep sack thing, crib, bassinet, Boppee pillow thing, bouncy, swing, laying on our bed and nothing works. She doesn't have a fever and we cant find anything else that could be wrong with her.\n\n\nMy wife is going crazy, now that I am going back to work she has to deal with the majority of it. I try to help, but she is so stressed all the time that it ends up with her just yelling at me to go to bed so I can get some sleep before work. I think my wife slept like maybe an hour and a half last night and now has to deal with the kids while im working today. She gets extreme guilt if she goes to take a nap while I watch the kids to the point where she can't even sleep. So she doesn't get much \"me time\". I suggested she use my noise cancelling headphones but she doesn't really want to do that.\n\n\nOur first son did not have any problems like this, he would sleep all the time, only getting up every 3 or 4 hours at night. He was in his own crib and room by a few months old sleeping through the night.\n\n\nWhat do we do? Trying to save my wife's sanity."

      "content": "This sounds like an absolutely exhausting and terrifying situation. Please know that what you and your wife are going through is incredibly common for parents of newborns, especially around the one-month mark. It is completely understandable why your wife is stressed\u2014sleep deprivation is a form of torture, and you are both doing an incredible job just surviving this period.\n\nIt is especially frustrating when your second child is so different from your first. The good news is that this is almost certainly a temporary developmental stage, not a permanent problem.\n\nHere is a breakdown of what might be happening and a plan focusing on two priorities: stabilizing your wife\u2019s mental health, and managing the baby\u2019s discomfort.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Understanding the 1-Month Shift (The \"Fourth Trimester\")\n\nThe first two weeks often involve a very sleepy baby. Around 3\u20135 weeks, babies \"wake up.\" Their nervous system is maturing, they become much more alert, and they often become incredibly fussy, especially in the late afternoon and evening. This is the peak time for what is often called **colic** or the **\"Witching Hour.\"**\n\nIf she is fed, dry, and has no fever, her crying is likely due to one of two things:\n\n1.  **Developmental Overload:** She needs help calming her nervous system down.\n2.  **Physical Discomfort:** Gas or mild reflux (GERD) that makes lying flat painful.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Immediate Action Plan for Your Wife's Sanity\n\nYour wife\u2019s guilt about resting is a massive barrier that you need to actively break down. You need to frame rest not as a luxury, but as a **mandatory safety requirement.** A rested caregiver is a safer caregiver.\n\n### A. Enforce a Protected Sleep Shift\n\nSince you are going back to work, you need to maximize the quality of the sleep she does get.\n\n*   **The 4-Hour Hand-Off:** When you get home from work, or before you go to bed, take a 4-hour shift where **you are 100% responsible for the baby, no exceptions.** Your wife must go to a separate room, turn off the monitor, and put in earplugs/headphones (even if she just listens to a podcast, the goal is to break the hyper-vigilance). If the baby cries, you deal with it. This 4 hours of dedicated, uninterrupted sleep debt repayment is crucial.\n*   **Daytime Nap Mandate:** On the weekend, or as soon as you are home, tell her you are taking the kids for a specific block of time (e.g., 2 hours). Give her a specific task that requires her to leave the house or the room (e.g., \"Go get coffee and browse the bookstore,\" or \"Go take a long bath and listen to music\"). Guilt is easier to manage when she is following an instruction rather than choosing to rest.\n\n### B. Address the Guilt/Hyper-Vigilance\n\nThe reason she can't sleep is likely due to the stress hormone cortisol and the fear that something will happen if she isn't listening.\n\n*   **Noise Cancellation Revisit:** If she refuses the headphones, try simple earplugs. The goal is to dampen the high-pitched screams enough so her nervous system can relax, but still allow her to hear if there is an urgent sound.\n*   **Lower the Standards:** Remind her that the only goals right now are feeding the baby and keeping everyone safe. The house can be messy. Meals can be takeout. If she is using her limited \"me time\" to clean, gently redirect her to rest.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Strategies for Comforting the Baby\n\nSince you have tried many products, let's focus on **technique and environment**\u2014specifically, how to recreate the womb experience.\n\nThe key technique for this age is often referred to as the **5 S\u2019s** (developed by Dr. Harvey Karp), which is designed to calm the baby\u2019s nervous system.\n\n### S1. Swaddle (Tight and Secure)\n\nYou mentioned swaddling, but if she is still crying, it might not be tight enough. The arms must be secured down to prevent the startle reflex. If she is breaking out, consider a specialized swaddle (like the Love to Dream or the Happiest Baby Sleepea) or a stronger technique.\n\n### S2. Side/Stomach Position (For Calming)\n\nBabies often hate being flat on their backs when they are upset. **Hold her on her side or tummy across your arm or chest** (always return her to her back for actual sleep). This position is often key to calming them down immediately.\n\n### S3. Shush (Loud White Noise)\n\nWhite noise needs to be **LOUD**\u2014as loud as a shower running, or even a vacuum cleaner\u2014to mimic the sound volume in the womb. Gentle shushing is often not enough. Use a dedicated machine or an app, and place it close to the bassinet.\n\n### S4. Swing/Sway (Rhythmic Movement)\n\nGentle rocking often doesn't work for a deeply upset baby. You often need **fast, tiny jiggles/bounces** while holding her securely. Think of the movement of a bumpy car ride or a vigorous bounce on a yoga ball.\n\n### S5. Suck (Pacifier or Finger)\n\nIf she is not hungry, offer a pacifier. Sucking is the ultimate self-soothing mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Addressing Potential Physical Discomfort (Reflux/Gas)\n\nSince she is crying even when fed and clean, consider minor gastrointestinal issues common at this age:\n\n*   **Post-Feeding Upright Time:** Keep her upright for a full **20\u201330 minutes** after every feeding, even if she seems asleep. This helps milk settle and prevents reflux pain when lying flat.\n*   **Gas Relief:** Try bicycles with her legs and gentle tummy massage to move gas. Over-the-counter simethicone gas drops (Mylicon, etc.) can sometimes help break up bubbles.\n*   **Consult the Pediatrician:** If the screaming is truly inconsolable, lasts for hours, and seems worse when she is lying flat, you need to talk to her doctor. Rule out severe reflux (GERD) or a food sensitivity (if your wife is breastfeeding, or if you are using a specific formula).\n\nYou are in the thick of what is often the hardest phase of the first year. It feels endless now, but this high-level need for comfort usually peaks around 6-8 weeks and then starts to slowly improve. Focus on getting your wife the sleep she needs, even if it means you take on the crying shifts. You are a great partner for recognizing how much she is struggling. Hang in there."
