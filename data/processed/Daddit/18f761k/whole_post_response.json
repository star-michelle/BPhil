All I wanted to do this weekend was put the ornaments on the tree\u2026no help. I get that she\u2019s tired but I\u2019ve been tired since Halloween. I\u2019m tired of feeling like I\u2019m raising my son without support. While my wife spends all her time wrapped up on Facebook and work drama. She got upset last night because she suggested a vacation I tossed out some ideas and she wasn\u2019t sure those would be good places to have a baby\u2026then got upset again when I said I wanted a vacation without the kid. My wife wants more kids\u2026I want help with the one we have now. \n\n\nI\u2019m just so completely fucking over it right now. I feel like asking for a few hours a week for her to actually be responsible for the kid isn\u2019t that big of a deal\u2026even when I get the time it still gets used for chores. Am I being ridiculous I\u2019m tired of my wife acting like I\u2019m high or have a sick growing out of my forehead when I ask for a little support. Someone help me out here I\u2019m at my wits end.\n\nOn mobile and watching the kid so sorry for weird formatting or anything."

      "content": "That sounds incredibly frustrating, overwhelming, and frankly, exhausting. Thank you for reaching out and sharing everything you're dealing with right now. It takes a lot of strength to admit how much you're struggling when you're already stretched so thin.\n\nTo answer your initial question directly: **Yes, absolutely.** There are definitely days\u2014and clearly, weeks and months\u2014when any parent, including dads, absolutely hates the *feeling* of being a parent, especially when they feel unsupported, overworked, and completely burned out. What you're experiencing is a very common feeling when the division of labor becomes this unbalanced.\n\nYou are definitely **not** being ridiculous.\n\nIt sounds like you are carrying an immense amount of mental and physical load, essentially acting as a full-time working single parent 24/7, even when your partner is physically present.\n\nLet's break down a few things you mentioned, because it sounds like there are a few distinct issues compounding your stress:\n\n### 1. The Imbalanced Division of Labor\n\nYou outlined a schedule where you already handle the heavy lift of the evenings (pickup, dinner, bath, bedtime\u2014the \"witching hour\" duties), dishes, and 5 nights a week of solo parenting.\n\nWhen your wife gets \"busy at work\" and excuses herself from her morning/daytime responsibilities (getting him up, feeding/changing, school drop-off, laundry), you are clearly absorbing **all** of that extra work.\n\n**What you are experiencing is not just physical tiredness; it's caregiver burnout and resentment.** When you spend your entire weekend doing chores and childcare while your partner focuses on Facebook and avoids responsibility (like the simple ask of putting ornaments on a tree), the feeling of being \"over it\" is completely justified.\n\n### 2. The Lack of Support and Dismissal\n\nIt is incredibly painful when you ask for support and are met with dismissal, anger, or avoidance (like her acting like you're \"high or have a sick growing out of your forehead\"). This is often called \"weaponized incompetence\" or simply a failure to meet your needs in the partnership.\n\n**Your need for a few hours of true time off, free from chores and childcare, is completely valid and necessary for your mental health.** The fact that any time you *do* get is immediately filled with chores means you are never truly getting a break.\n\n### 3. The Future Planning Disconnect (More Kids)\n\nThis is a critical point. You want help with the child you have; your wife wants more children. This suggests a massive disconnect in your current priorities and expectations for the future.\n\nIt is perfectly reasonable to say, \"We cannot discuss expanding our family until we have a functional, equitable system for raising the child we currently have.\" You cannot pour from an empty cup, and you certainly cannot handle *two* children alone.\n\n---\n\n### What Can You Do Now?\n\nSince you are at your wits' end, you need a strategy to communicate your needs clearly and effectively.\n\n#### A. Schedule a Real Conversation (When You Are Not Watching the Kid)\n\nYou need to move this conversation away from the moment of crisis (like when you are bathing the child or she is on her phone).\n\n1.  **Set the Time:** \"Honey, we need to sit down and talk about the division of labor and my burnout. I need 30 minutes of your focused attention tonight after [Kid] is asleep, or tomorrow before work.\"\n2.  **Use \"I\" Statements:** Focus on how *you* feel, not what *she* is doing wrong.\n    *   *Instead of:* \"You never help and you're always on Facebook.\"\n    *   *Try:* \"I feel completely overwhelmed and unsupported when I am doing 100% of the childcare and chores, even on your days off. I have been tired since Halloween, and I am reaching a breaking point.\"\n3.  **Define the Problem with Data:** Use the last few weeks as evidence.\n    *   \"For the last two weeks, I have done every single diaper change. That is not a partnership. Our agreement has broken down.\"\n\n#### B. Redefine the \"Break\"\n\nYou need guaranteed, chore-free, child-free time.\n\n*   **Be Specific:** Instead of asking for \"support,\" ask for time. \"I need Saturday morning, from 9 AM to 1 PM, completely off. I will leave the house. You are fully responsible for all childcare and household needs during that time. I will not be doing laundry, dishes, or errands.\"\n*   **Insist on Reciprocity:** You need to make it clear that if she needs time off from her responsibilities, you need time off from yours, and the workload must remain equitable.\n\n#### C. Address the Vacation/More Kids Issue\n\nYou need to draw a clear boundary here:\n\n*   \"I am not willing to discuss having more children until we have established a fair, balanced, and reliable system for raising our current son. I feel like I am raising him alone, and I cannot commit to more until that changes.\"\n*   \"Regarding vacation: I need a vacation where I am not solely responsible for parenting. I need a break from being the primary parent, and if that means taking a weekend trip alone or with friends, that is what I need to do for my mental health.\"\n\nWhat you are asking for is basic fairness and respect in your partnership. **It is not a big ask.** You are doing an incredible job under impossible circumstances. Please be kind to yourself right now.\n\n**If your wife continues to dismiss your feelings or refuses to engage in a necessary change, you may need to consider couples counseling.** This is not about blaming, but about getting a neutral third party to help you both see the imbalance and create a functional schedule that prevents you from burning out completely."
