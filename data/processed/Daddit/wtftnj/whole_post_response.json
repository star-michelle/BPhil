      "content": "physical job, NEED SLEEP...\n\nThis is my first time posting here... So I just wanted to put this out there for opinions to see if I'm asking for to much or being unreasonable?\n\nSo I'm a dad of three, one 3yr old and two 5 week old twins. It's been a massive shock to the system trying to adjust... We always just wanted 2 kids but it is what it is. \n\nI am a self employed gardener and do everything myself, it's hard work at the best of times. Mowing, hedge trimming, strimming and clearing, digging borders, bagging waste etc etc... I can easily do 10,000 steps a day. \n\nAs you can imagine, sleep is pretty non-existent at the moment.. multiple feeds, wakes and all that fun stuff. Our 3yr old still isn't a great sleeper as he suffers with night terrors. \n\nThe absolute hardest thing for me is the sleep deprivation... It's the worst I've ever experienced (borderline delusional at times) I have had days off work because of it, and the day's I'm working it pretty much doesn't even feel safe to drive let alone use machinery and all the rest.. I've actually never been good on little sleep, some people seem to be able to cope better than others I find.\n\nAnyway... I've said to my wife about needed more sleep for work, I suggested the spare room and offered to help out in other ways as much as I can.. the problem is we're butting heads as she says she absolutely cannot do the nights alone. Don't get me wrong I feel guilty suggesting in the first place but I'm basically on my knees with exhaustion and we can't seem to meet in the middle unfortunately.\n\nShe is a \"stay at home mum\" for now at least. And I'm in no way saying that it's easier but in my opinion having such a physical job and the added financial pressure of being self employed really isn't easy."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult situation, and first, I want to say that what you are describing\u2014managing a physical job, being self-employed, having a 3-year-old with night terrors, and caring for 5-week-old twins\u2014is not just \"hard,\" it is **survival mode**.\n\nThe level of exhaustion you are experiencing is completely understandable, and the guilt you feel about asking for help is common, but please try to set it aside for a moment.\n\nLet's address your core question directly:\n\n### Are you asking for too much or being unreasonable?\n\n**Absolutely not.**\n\nWhen your job involves driving and operating machinery (mowers, trimmers, etc.), getting sufficient sleep moves beyond a comfort issue and becomes a **critical safety requirement**\u2014for yourself, for your clients, and for the public. Borderline delusional exhaustion is a legitimate danger signal. You are not asking for a luxury; you are asking for the ability to perform your demanding, income-generating job safely.\n\nThe problem is that both you and your wife are correct in your feelings:\n\n*   **You are correct:** You need uninterrupted sleep to function safely and maintain the family income.\n*   **She is correct:** Handling two newborns and a 3-year-old with night terrors alone for an entire night is terrifying and unsustainable for her.\n\nThe challenge is finding a strategy that allows **both** of you to get some restorative sleep, even if it's not a full eight hours yet.\n\n---\n\n## Finding the Middle Ground: Structured Sleep Shifts\n\nThe current \"I go to the spare room and you handle everything\" vs. \"We both suffer together\" model is clearly not working. You need to frame this as a partnership strategy to ensure the family's safety and financial stability.\n\nThe most effective solution for parents of multiples is the **Structured Sleep Shift (or Protected Sleep)** model.\n\n### 1. Define Your Protected Sleep Block\n\nYou need a solid, uninterrupted block of sleep for safety. This is non-negotiable for the physical demands of your job.\n\n*   **Example:** You go to the spare room (or wear heavy-duty earplugs in the main room) from **10:00 PM to 4:00 AM.**\n*   During this time, your wife handles the twins (and the 3-year-old's terrors, if they occur). This is the shift where she is \"alone,\" but it is only for 6 hours.\n\n### 2. Define Her Protected Sleep Block\n\nThe key to getting your wife on board is ensuring that she gets her own guaranteed recovery time.\n\n*   **The Hand-Off:** At **4:00 AM**, you are on duty. You come out of the spare room, and your wife goes immediately to bed (or to the spare room).\n*   **Your Shift (4:00 AM to 7:00 AM):** You manage the twins' feeds, changes, and settling until you absolutely have to leave for work. Crucially, if the 3-year-old wakes up, you handle him completely.\n*   This 3-hour window allows your wife to get a deep, restorative block of sleep before the 3-year-old is up for the day.\n\nThis structure means you both get a guaranteed, albeit short, block of uninterrupted sleep, which is far better than the current broken cycle.\n\n### 3. Dividing the 3-Year-Old Responsibilities\n\nThe 3-year-old's night terrors are a massive factor that complicates things.\n\n*   **Can you agree that if the 3-year-old wakes up with a night terror, you handle it immediately, regardless of the time?** This might alleviate some of the pressure on your wife, who is trying to soothe twins at the same time. This is a targeted way you can \"help out in other ways\" during the night without completely sacrificing your ability to drive safely the next day.\n\n### 4. Daytime Support\n\nSince your wife is a stay-at-home mum, her work never stops. If she can get a solid nap during the day, she will be much better equipped to handle her night shift.\n\n*   **Weekend Catch-Up:** Dedicate one day on the weekend where you take the 3-year-old out for 4-5 hours (park, library, etc.) while the twins are napping, so your wife can get a huge chunk of sleep.\n*   **Outsource Housework:** If you can afford it, even a bi-weekly cleaning service can take a load off her plate and free up her mental energy.\n\n### Talking to Your Wife\n\nWhen you bring this up again, focus on safety and partnership, not blame or comparison of jobs.\n\n**Instead of:** \"I need to sleep more because my job is harder than yours.\"\n**Try:** \"I am genuinely scared for my safety when I drive the truck right now, and I cannot risk losing our income or getting hurt. I know you cannot do the night alone, so let's figure out a structured plan where we both get a guaranteed block of sleep. I need 6 hours of protected sleep, and I promise to cover the 4 AM to 7 AM shift completely so you can get deep sleep before the day starts.\"\n\nYou are a great dad and partner for trying to find a solution. This stage with twins and a toddler is temporary, but the exhaustion is real. Be kind to yourselves, communicate the danger of the sleep deprivation clearly, and work together to implement a shift plan immediately."
