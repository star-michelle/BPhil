Love him to death, but i am struggling really hard during the nights. \n\nI use to see posts of dad's expressing their frustration, anxiety, and stress about their newborns, and I'd think to myself, \"can't be THAT bad.\" .... Oh boy, was I wrong!\n\nI'm at the point now that I get super irritated at this poor, helpless baby boy when he cries at night. More so at the fact of NOT KNOWING what to do after we have checked all the boxes (fed, diaper, burp, etc.). I have even said the whole, \"we may have made a mistake\" thing to my wife and few times. Even though I don't truly mean it. \n\nEvery night, I tell myself that tonight I will do better when he wakes us up screaming and won't settle down. No matter what. And I seem to always fail by getting frustrated. I feel incredibly low and like I'm letting down my son and my wife.... \n\nFor those who have gone through this, I could really use some advice it even words of encouragement cause... damn... being a dad is way tougher than I thought.

      "content": "This is incredibly brave of you to share, and I want to start by validating everything you are feeling. **What you are going through is absolutely normal, incredibly difficult, and you are definitely not failing.**\n\nThe transition to parenthood, especially with a newborn, is often described as a shock, and the sleep deprivation combined with the pressure to \"fix\" the crying is a perfect storm for frustration. You were right to come here for support.\n\nHere are a few thoughts, pieces of advice, and words of encouragement, focusing on the immediate challenges you\u2019re facing at night:\n\n---\n\n### 1. You Are Not Failing (The Reality Check)\n\nFirst, let's address the feeling of failure.\n\n**You are not failing your son or your wife. You are a sleep-deprived human being reacting to a highly stressful situation.**\n\n*   **You are doing the hard work:** You are checking all the boxes (fed, diaper, burp). That is excellent, attentive parenting.\n*   **The feeling of frustration is a symptom of exhaustion, not a moral failing.** It is a protective mechanism saying, \"I need rest and I need this stressor to stop.\" You feel this way because you care deeply and are trying so hard.\n*   **The \"We made a mistake\" thought:** Every parent who has been through extreme newborn sleep deprivation has had a dark thought like this. It is a fleeting, irrational thought born from exhaustion. The fact that you know you don't mean it shows how much you truly love your son.\n\n### 2. The 5 S\u2019s and the \"Fourth Trimester\"\n\nYour two-week-old is still essentially experiencing life outside the womb. The world is loud, bright, and confusing. When all the standard boxes are checked, the baby is usually crying because they are overstimulated, under-stimulated, or need help regulating their nervous system.\n\nIf you haven't already, look into Dr. Harvey Karp's **\"The 5 S's\"** method. These are designed to mimic the womb environment and are often the magic solution when nothing else works:\n\n1.  **Swaddling:** Tightly wrapping the baby (ensuring it's done safely). This is crucial for controlling the moro reflex.\n2.  **Side or Stomach Position:** Holding the baby on their side or stomach (only while being held, never for sleep).\n3.  **Shushing:** Loud, continuous white noise (think as loud as a running shower, since the womb is loud).\n4.  **Swinging:** Small, rhythmic movements (rocking, bouncing).\n5.  **Sucking:** Pacifier, finger, or bottle.\n\n### 3. Strategy for Managing Your Frustration\n\nThis is the most critical part for your mental health and safety. When you feel that surge of irritation, you need a pre-planned exit strategy.\n\n#### A. The 5-Minute Rule\n\nIf you are holding your son and feel your blood pressure rising, your jaw clenching, or you feel the urge to yell, **put the baby down safely in the crib or bassinet, and step away for 5 minutes.**\n\n*   He is safe. He is crying, but he is safe.\n*   Go to the bathroom, splash cold water on your face, take 10 deep breaths, or text your wife, \"I need a break.\"\n*   **This is not abandoning him; this is prioritizing safety and regulating yourself so you can come back better.** This is a sign of strength, not failure.\n\n#### B. Hand-Offs Are Mandatory\n\nSleep deprivation is a form of torture. You and your wife need a plan for defined shifts, even if they are short.\n\n*   **The \"Truce\" Word:** Establish a word or phrase that means, \"I am at my limit and I need you to take over immediately, without judgment.\"\n*   **Shift Example:** Maybe your wife takes 8 PM to 1 AM, and you take 1 AM to 6 AM. The person *off-duty* wears earplugs and is completely unavailable. Even if the shifts are only 3 hours long, knowing you have a guaranteed block of rest coming can be a lifeline.\n\n### 4. Adjusting Your Expectations\n\nYou are telling yourself, \"Tonight I will do better... and won't settle down.\"\n\n**Your definition of \"better\" needs to change right now.**\n\n*   \"Doing better\" is not about silencing the baby instantly.\n*   **\"Doing better\" is about controlling your reaction to the crying.**\n*   The goal is to survive the night safely and calmly, even if the baby cries for an hour straight.\n\n**A successful night is one where you kept your cool, followed your exit strategy when needed, and everyone woke up safe.** That\u2019s it.\n\n### Words of Encouragement\n\nYou are in the eye of the storm. These first few weeks are often described as the hardest phase of the entire parenting journey because of the sheer unpredictability and lack of sleep.\n\n**It gets better.**\n\nIn a few short weeks:\n\n*   Your son's stomach will mature, reducing some of the discomfort.\n*   He will start to become more interested in the world, which will help with daytime wakefulness and nighttime settling.\n*   You will start to recognize his different cries and patterns, which will reduce the feeling of powerlessness.\n\nHang in there, Dad. You are a great dad because you are introspective enough to recognize your struggle and seek help. Be kind to yourself. You are doing an amazing job under impossible circumstances."
