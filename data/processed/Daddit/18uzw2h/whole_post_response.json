      "content": "MIL gave my baby an unknown medication.\n\nWe have two boys, 6 and 34 months. We lean pretty heavily on my in-laws for baby sitting and stop-gap childcare: In addition to baby-sitting as-required, Eldest spends Monday and Wednesday nights at their home after preschool (at in-laws' request). They love him immensely and spoil him, which is kinda their job as grandparents IMO. They don't do everything the way we would, and sometimes I worry that too much time there is creating more difficulties for us in the long run, but in general it's a pill I can swallow.\n\nTonight they were babysitting at our place so we could have dinner with a friend. I had already put Eldest to bed, so once my wife had fed Youngest, they just had to get him to sleep, and call us if anything went sideways in the next 2.5h.\n\nWe got home from dinner and MIL informed us that Youngest had been very fussy before sleep. He is teething, and she is aware. Administering baby Tylenol/Advil to Youngest has been immensely difficult, so we didn't bother to leave any out for them to give him. This didn't stop MIL from raiding our medicine cabinet to find some Tylenol for him.\n\n\"Ok. How much did you give him?\" asks my wife, an ER Doctor.\n\n\"Just a few drops in this spoon\" says MIL, showing the spoon and the bottle of *topical oral anesthetic (lidocaine)* she took from our medicine cabinet!\n\nHere's the rub, daddit: They did not read the label to see it was not Tylenol or acetaminophen or Advil or ibuprofen (the bottle was very clearly labelled as \"topical oral anesthetic\" ie, not Tylenol). They did not read the warnings on the label clearly stating that it can affect the swallowing reflex in children and not to use it for teething relief for babies. They did not measure out any kind of calculated dose. In essence, they grabbed the first bottle of red syrup they saw and put as much of it as seemed reasonable to them into the mouth of our 6 month old baby.\n\nFor those wondering (as I obviously was), there was no immediate cause for alarm. Youngest is fine; the amount given to our son was not harmful.\n\nBut what if it had been?\n\nThe way I see it, MIL endangered our baby son's life tonight. That could have been any one of thousands of pharmacological compounds that could have harmed him. They could have tried to give him more than they did. He could have gotten really sick. Or worse. I'm livid. I'm dumbfounded they would do something so jaw-droppingly stupid as to administer an unmeasured dose of an unknown medication to an infant -- our baby -- without even so much as texting us first.\n\nMy in-laws were out the door before I could even comprehend what happened (they are Romanian and don't always speak English, so I don't always get the whole picture right away), let alone process it.\n\nWe have every intention of having a very frank and stern conversation with them about this. My feeling is that we can't trust them alone with either of my boys again unless they acknowledge the gravity of that decision and sincerely apologize. My wife feels similarly. Problem is, we have a lot of reason to expect they won't respond so reasonably. If they don't, we lose the immeasurable support they've been providing. That will strain our collective sanity, our wallets, and I'm sure our marriage as well.\n\nHow would you feel, and what would you do if you were in my shoes, daddit?"

      "content": "This is an incredibly stressful and frightening situation. You are absolutely right to be livid and terrified. The feeling that your child\u2019s life was endangered\u2014even if the actual harm was negligible this time\u2014is a primal, justified reaction.\n\nHere is how I would feel, and a structured approach to what I would do in your shoes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How I Would Feel (Validation)\n\nI would feel profoundly violated, angry, and terrified. The fact that your wife is an ER doctor adds another layer of gravity, as she understands the risks of unknown pharmacology better than most.\n\nThis was not a mistake of parenting style (like too many sweets or late bedtime); this was a catastrophic lapse in judgment regarding basic medical safety. Your MIL did three things that are non-negotiable failures when caring for an infant:\n\n1.  **Administered an Unknown Substance:** She did not confirm what the medication was.\n2.  **Failed to Read Warnings:** She ignored clear instructions against use in infants/for teething.\n3.  **Failed to Dose:** She administered an unmeasured, arbitrary amount.\n\nThe danger is immense, and your anger is completely warranted. The immediate safety of your child must override all concerns about convenience, family harmony, or the loss of childcare support.\n\n## 2. Immediate, Non-Negotiable Action Steps\n\nBefore you even have the big conversation, you need to secure your home.\n\n### A. Secure All Medications\nYou must immediately remove or lock up every single pharmacological item (prescription and over-the-counter) that is not explicitly baby Tylenol/Advil.\n\n*   **Move everything.** Put adult medications, topical ointments, supplements, and anything else in a locked box, or move them entirely out of the house (e.g., to your wife\u2019s office or a high, locked cabinet).\n*   **The Only Exception:** If you choose to leave out baby pain relief, it must be only *that specific bottle*, clearly labeled in English and Romanian (if possible), with a pre-measured syringe, and a note stating: **\"DO NOT USE ANY OTHER BOTTLE.\"**\n\n### B. Unite with Your Wife\nYou and your wife must be a completely unified front. Since she is the medical professional, her voice holds enormous weight. Draft the talking points together and agree on the absolute boundaries before you speak to them.\n\n## 3. The Conversation Strategy\n\nYou need to schedule a formal, serious conversation soon, ideally with both you and your wife present, and without the children around.\n\n### Step 1: Set the Tone and Acknowledge Support\nStart by acknowledging their immense love for the boys and the invaluable support they provide. This is crucial to prevent them from immediately shutting down defensively.\n\n*   *Example:* \"We rely on you both so much, and we know how much you love the boys. We wouldn't be able to manage without your help.\"\n\n### Step 2: Clearly State the Incident and the Danger\nYour wife needs to explain the medical severity in clear, stark terms. Focus on the *action* (the failure to read the label and measure), not the *person*.\n\n*   *Wife\u2019s Role:* \"When you gave Youngest the red liquid, you gave him lidocaine, which is a powerful anesthetic, not Tylenol. The label specifically warns against this because it can affect his ability to swallow and breathe. If you had given him just a little more, or if it had been a different drug, we could have been rushing him to the emergency room, or worse.\"\n*   *Your Role (Focusing on Trust):* \"It wasn't just that it was the wrong drug; it was that you didn't read the label or measure the dose. That shows us that you prioritized getting him to sleep over his safety, and that has destroyed our trust.\"\n\n### Step 3: State the New, Non-Negotiable Rules\nThis is where you clearly define the new boundaries. These rules must be written down and posted visibly.\n\n*   **Rule Zero: Medication:** \"If the boys need any medication\u2014even Tylenol\u2014you must call or text us first. If we do not answer, you do not administer anything. Nothing. If you feel he is in pain, comfort him, but do not touch the medicine cabinet.\"\n*   **Access to Cabinets:** \"All medications are now locked away. This is for the boys\u2019 safety, and this is permanent.\"\n*   **The Consequence:** \"We cannot allow you to babysit alone until we know you understand the gravity of this and agree to follow these rules perfectly.\"\n\n### Step 4: Require Acknowledgment and Apology\nYou stated that you need them to acknowledge the gravity and sincerely apologize. This is your leverage point.\n\n*   \"We need to hear from you that you understand that what you did was dangerous and that you are sorry for putting Youngest at risk. We need to know that this will never happen again.\"\n\n## 4. Addressing the Potential Fallout (The Contingency Plan)\n\nYou are right to anticipate that they may react poorly. They might deny, deflect, or claim you are overreacting. This is typical when deeply held assumptions (like \"I know how to care for a baby\") are challenged.\n\n**If they refuse to acknowledge the gravity or apologize:**\n\nYou must be prepared to follow through on the consequence: **A pause in unsupervised childcare.**\n\nSafety must always come before convenience. If they cannot agree to the simple rule of \"call first\" and \"read the label,\" they have demonstrated they cannot be trusted with unsupervised care. Losing their support will be brutally difficult, but it is better than living with the constant fear that they might make another, potentially fatal, mistake.\n\n*   **Temporary Measures:** If support is pulled, you will need to immediately implement a short-term plan:\n    *   Adjusting your work schedules (evenings, early mornings).\n    *   Hiring a temporary, professional sitter to cover the critical Monday/Wednesday night gaps.\n    *   Utilizing any vacation time or sick leave you have available.\n\n**If they apologize and agree to the rules:**\n\nYou can slowly reintroduce unsupervised time. However, you must implement a \"trial period.\"\n\n*   **The Trial:** For the next month, supervision should be limited to short periods, and you must check in frequently. Every time they babysit, reiterate the medication rule. If they break the rule (even a small one, like giving a non-approved snack), you must immediately pull back on the support again.\n\nWhat happened tonight was terrifying. Your focus now needs to be on establishing and maintaining clear, firm boundaries that prioritize your children's safety, even if that means navigating a difficult, but necessary, relationship shift."
