She will make hunger cues, sticking tongue out, suckling hands, rooting with her mouth, but when she is placed next to a nipple/boob (both football and cross over positions) she will either suck a little while poorly latched, hurting my wife, then start screaming or she will just scream and push away, yet scream and make hunger cues. We know she is hungry because it\u2019ll be 2-3 hours between attempts.  We\u2019ve resorted to pumping and using a super low flow nipple bottle so we know she\u2019s getting fed because she cries so much when trying to latch, my decision because I\u2019d rather know she is fed.\n\nWe were in hospital for 3 days due to c section and we had lactation visit us, but every time they came she latched almost perfectly, and at for 20minutes. Except the last time as I was away packing car up the lactation nurse was thinking of keep us there another day then squirt finally latched. When they weren\u2019t there, it was a struggle as it is now at home! She\u2019s like the reversed Michigan j frog. \n\nDuring hospital stay bean would spit up during the night, she would finally fall asleep, but then nurses would come make her mad and then leave \ud83d\ude21. Leaving my poor wife stay up with her to try and feed, whenever I tried to hold her she\u2019d start making feeding cues but would proceed to cry, fight and push away from Mom! Doesn\u2019t help that daughter didn\u2019t poop until we got her home, although she did have a big one during labor, then she had 2 back to back. \n\nAdd in that she has her days and night switched and will sleep during the day with occasional cries that stop the nap attempt and then at night she will not sleep anywhere else but in someone\u2019s arms. \n\nMy questions are numerous so thanks in advance for any help:\n\n1. Baby won\u2019t latch even trying the lip tease, expressing milk, etc. she makes hunger cues but fights at the nipple, will get a nipple shield today **what else can I do to help, I refuse to feel helpless while my wife cries?** (she already gets overwhelmed emotionally just like her mother, add in a huge estrogen dump and it\u2019s brutal)\n\n2. What else can we try to get her to latch? She knows she\u2019s hungry, she knows she needs something in her mouth, but when she gets it she screams with a nipple in her mouth and pushes away!\n\n3. Nights and days swapped, won\u2019t sleep in bassinet only sleeps when held at night (naturally angled), spit ups. Is this possible signs of reflux? \n\n4. Why does she let out sudden cries when sleeping and sometimes a simple shhhh shhhh will soothe her? \n\n5. I decided to give her the bottle of pumped milk, it was either that or she starve. My wife tried pumping this morning and only got like 1oz from each side, should I start researching formula? \n\n6. Should we increase how often we just try to feed her? Sort of feeding before she really makes the motions?\n\n\nThanks again /r/daddit, I hope my sleep deprived state came across well, any other tips will be greatly appreciated!"

      "content": "This sounds incredibly challenging. Please know that what you and your wife are going through is completely normal for the postpartum period, especially with a newborn who is only four days old. You are both doing an amazing job under stressful, sleep-deprived circumstances, and your instinct to step in and make sure your daughter is fed is exactly what a great partner and father does.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed and helpless. Let's break down these issues.\n\n***Please note: I am an AI, and this information is for support and general guidance only. You and your wife need immediate, professional, in-person support from a certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) and your pediatrician.***\n\n---\n\n## Addressing Your Immediate Concerns\n\n### 1. Baby Won\u2019t Latch & Feeling Helpless\n\nYou are doing the absolute best thing by being proactive and supportive. Your wife needs you to be her shield, her advocate, and her support system right now.\n\n**What you can do immediately (beyond getting the nipple shield):**\n\n*   **Take Over the Logistics:** Your job right now is to manage everything *except* the direct breastfeeding attempts and healing. This includes:\n    *   **Feeding Management:** Sterilizing pump parts, washing bottles, preparing the pumped milk, tracking input/output (wet diapers, poops).\n    *   **Household Management:** Ordering food, doing laundry, managing visitors/phone calls, keeping the house quiet and dark at night.\n    *   **Wife Care:** Make sure she has water, snacks, pain medication (if prescribed), and uninterrupted time to shower or nap. Her emotional well-being is paramount right now.\n*   **Be the Gatekeeper:** Limit visitors, turn off phones, and create a calm, low-stress environment for feeding attempts. Stress hormones (like cortisol) can inhibit the let-down reflex.\n*   **Skin-to-Skin (Dad Edition):** Hold the baby skin-to-skin on your chest. This is incredibly calming for the baby, regulates their temperature and heart rate, and gives your wife a break. A calm baby is often a better feeder.\n*   **Find Professional Help (Urgent):**\n    *   **Call the Pediatrician:** Inform them about the poor latch, low output, and your decision to bottle-feed pumped milk. They need to monitor her weight and jaundice levels (which can cause sleepiness/poor feeding).\n    *   **Hire an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant):** Do not rely on the hospital staff who only came for quick visits. You need a private consultant who can spend 1-2 hours observing a full feeding cycle in your home environment. They can check for anatomical issues (tongue/lip ties) and correct latch mechanics. This is the **most crucial step** you can take right now.\n\n### 2. What Else to Try to Get Her to Latch?\n\nThe screaming at the breast is a classic sign of a hungry, frustrated baby who can't coordinate the latch or the milk flow is too slow/fast for her.\n\n*   **The Problem:** Your daughter has learned that the bottle is an easy, fast reward for her hunger cues, while the breast is frustrating and hard work. This is called **\"nipple confusion\"** or **\"flow preference.\"**\n*   **Strategies to Try:**\n    *   **Biological Nurturing/Laid-Back Position:** Have your wife recline way back (like on a couch or bed). Place the baby tummy-to-tummy on her chest. Gravity helps stabilize the baby, and this position triggers natural feeding instincts. Let the baby root and find the nipple herself.\n    *   **Switching States:** Don't wait until she is screaming (past the point of hunger). Try to latch her when she is just waking up, still drowsy, or very relaxed.\n    *   **Pumping Beforehand (The Express/Softening Trick):** If your wife is engorged, the areola can be too hard for the baby to latch onto. Have her pump for just 2-3 minutes to trigger a let-down and soften the area, making the nipple more prominent.\n    *   **The Nipple Shield:** If the IBCLC recommends it, use the shield. It can offer a firmer shape for the baby to hold onto and manage the flow. **But use it under professional guidance,** as it can sometimes reduce milk transfer if not used correctly.\n\n### 3. Nights and Days Swapped & Spit-Ups\n\nYes, the day/night confusion and the need to be held angled (especially at night) can be **possible signs of reflux** (Gastroesophageal Reflux or GER), but it is also **extremely common in newborns.**\n\n*   **Newborn Normalcy:** Babies have tiny stomachs, immature sphincters, and often prefer to sleep upright because they are used to being held that way in the womb. The day/night confusion is also standard\u2014they sleep when Mom is moving during the day and wake up when things are quiet at night.\n*   **What you can do:**\n    *   **Address the Day/Night Swap:**\n        *   **Daytime:** Keep the house bright, noisy (normal activity), and actively wake her every 2-3 hours for a feeding attempt.\n        *   **Nighttime:** Keep the house dark, quiet, and boring. Limit interaction to the necessities (feeding, diaper change) and don't talk much.\n    *   **Reflux/Spit-Up Strategy:** Keep her upright for 20-30 minutes after every feeding (even if she falls asleep). If she is spitting up a lot, talk to the pediatrician about whether thickened feeds or other interventions are necessary. **Never put a baby to sleep on an incline that is not designed for safe sleep** (like car seats or pillows) as this increases SIDS risk. Only use the bassinet/crib when flat.\n\n### 4. Sudden Cries While Sleeping\n\nThis is almost certainly **normal newborn behavior.**\n\n*   Newborns have very active sleep cycles (REM sleep) where they twitch, grunt, sigh, and often let out sudden, piercing cries that are not true distress signals. They are still adjusting to life outside the womb.\n*   The fact that a simple \"shhh\" soothes her suggests she is in a light sleep stage and just needs reassurance that she is safe. This will improve as her nervous system matures.\n\n### 5. Pumping Output & Formula\n\nYou made the right decision. **A fed baby is the priority.** Do not feel guilty about ensuring she gets milk.\n\n*   **Pumping Output (1 oz per side):** At four days postpartum, this is actually **very normal.** Your wife is still producing colostrum and the transitional milk is just coming in. Full milk supply usually doesn't ramp up until days 5-7. Do not panic about this low number yet.\n*   **The Key to Supply:** Milk supply is based on **demand.** Since the baby isn't latching well, your wife must pump frequently to signal her body to make more milk.\n    *   **Pump Schedule:** She should be pumping **8-10 times in 24 hours** (including one session overnight), aiming for every 2-3 hours. If she misses a nursing attempt, she *must* pump to replace that demand.\n*   **Formula:** If the baby is not getting enough pumped milk (which the pediatrician will help you determine via weight checks), you can use formula as a **supplement (or bridge)** while you work on improving the latch and supply with the IBCLC. **Supplementation does not mean the end of breastfeeding.**\n\n### 6. Increasing Feeding Frequency\n\n**Yes, absolutely.**\n\n*   You should be offering the breast **8-12 times in 24 hours.**\n*   If she is consistently sleeping for 3 hours during the day, you need to wake her up to offer a feeding attempt.\n*   **The goal is to offer the breast first, every time.** If she refuses after a calm attempt, then give the bottle of pumped milk, and then immediately pump to protect the supply.\n\n---\n\n## Action Plan for the Next 24 Hours\n\n1.  **Contact an IBCLC immediately.** Get a home visit scheduled for today or tomorrow.\n2.  **Call the Pediatrician.** Schedule a weight check for the baby today or tomorrow to ensure she is not dehydrated or losing too much weight.\n3.  **Implement the Pumping Schedule:** Your wife needs to pump 8-10 times in 24 hours, even if she only gets a small amount.\n4.  **Try Laid-Back Nursing:** Attempt the reclined, skin-to-skin feeding position when the baby is drowsy, not screaming hungry.\n5.  **Focus on Dad's Role:** Manage the environment, the logistics (pumping/bottles), and provide emotional support and reassurance to your wife. Remind her that she is doing an amazing job.\n\nYou are doing great, Dad. This is the hardest part of the newborn stage, but you will get through it. Get the professional help you need!"
