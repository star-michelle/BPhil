How and when do my wife and I know if it's time for adoption.\n\nMy wife is struggling with severe anxiety, I am not doing any better either. Our daughter is 15 days and we are both struggling so much. We had the MIL come in for a night of relief but that didn't change anything. I really want the best life for my daughter and at this point I know she is not getting it. I have a therapist appointment this week, plus I am going to visit my doctor. I am trying to take the steps I can to get better but I'm just not sure what to do. My wife and I were so in love before this and we've both said so many times that we miss each other through these first few weeks..Has anybody gone through this process before. I will add that our daughter is a pretty decent kid, she wakes everynight around 3 hours, she's a bit fussy all through the day but all in all she's not a crying horrible child. That's what's making me think that maybe we aren't the best parents for her. I've read a lot of messages on this site and I know some might come at me hard for thinking this way but I'm just not sure about this."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult and emotional place to be, and I want to start by acknowledging how much courage it takes to voice these feelings. What you are experiencing right now is real, painful, and exhausting. Thank you for reaching out and sharing this with me.\n\nPlease, take a deep breath. What you are describing\u2014the severe anxiety, the feeling that you are both struggling immensely, the worry that your daughter isn't getting the best life, and the longing for the relationship you and your wife had\u2014is **extremely common** in the first few weeks after bringing a newborn home.\n\nIt sounds like you are wrestling with two very important things right now:\n\n1.  **The immediate, acute crisis of exhaustion and mental health struggles.**\n2.  **The long-term question of whether adoption is the right path.**\n\nLet's address these in turn.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Addressing the Immediate Crisis\n\nYou are 15 days into parenthood. This is often called the \"fourth trimester,\" and it is a period of maximum physical and emotional upheaval. Your daughter is a newborn, and you and your wife are recovering from birth, dealing with massive hormonal shifts (especially your wife), and experiencing severe sleep deprivation.\n\nThe fact that you are both struggling with anxiety and that your relationship feels strained is **not** a reflection of your potential to be good parents, but a reflection of the intense stress you are currently under.\n\n**The most crucial step you can take right now is the one you are already taking:**\n\n*   **You are seeking professional help.** Your upcoming therapist appointment and visit to the doctor are vital. Please be completely honest with them about the severity of your anxiety, your wife's anxiety, and the thoughts you are having about adoption and your capacity to parent. They can assess you for **Postpartum Depression (PPD)** and **Postpartum Anxiety (PPA)**, which affect fathers as well as mothers, and are highly treatable.\n*   **Your wife also needs professional assessment.** Given the severity of her anxiety, she should also see her doctor or OB-GYN immediately to discuss her mental health. PPA/PPD can make even simple tasks feel impossible, and it severely distorts your perspective on reality and your abilities.\n\n**Regarding the thoughts about adoption:**\n\nIt is completely understandable that when you are in the depths of exhaustion and mental anguish, your mind searches for the quickest way to solve the pain, and that solution sometimes looks like removing the stressor (the baby).\n\n**However, the vast majority of parents who feel this way in the first few weeks, once treated for PPD/PPA and given adequate support, go on to thrive as parents.**\n\n**The question of adoption is a long-term decision that should not be made during an acute mental health crisis.** You need time to heal, stabilize your emotions, get proper sleep, and see the world clearly again before making a permanent decision about your daughter's future.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Recognizing Normal Newborn Behavior vs. Parental Failure\n\nYou mentioned that your daughter is a \"pretty decent kid,\" waking every 3 hours, and is \"a bit fussy.\"\n\n**This is absolutely normal newborn behavior.** A 15-day-old baby who wakes every 3 hours to eat is doing exactly what she is supposed to do. The fussiness is normal; she is adjusting to life outside the womb.\n\nThe fact that you interpret this normal, manageable behavior as a sign that you are failing is strong evidence that **your anxiety and exhaustion are clouding your judgment.** Good parents often feel like failures in the first month because they are exhausted and anxious. Bad parents usually don't care enough to worry this much.\n\n**The fact that you care so deeply about giving her the best life is the strongest evidence that you *are* a good parent.**\n\n---\n\n## What to Do Next (Before Considering Adoption)\n\nBefore you seriously consider adoption, you need to commit to getting out of this crisis mode. This means focusing on **support and treatment** for the next 4\u20136 weeks.\n\n### A. Focus on Immediate Relief\n\n1.  **Prioritize Sleep (Yours and Your Wife's):** This is non-negotiable. Sleep deprivation is a form of torture and fuels anxiety.\n    *   **Implement \"Shifts\":** If possible, you and your wife need to agree to blocks of uninterrupted sleep (4\u20135 hours minimum). One parent wears earplugs and sleeps in a separate room while the other is on duty.\n    *   **Use the MIL or other help for Naps:** Can your MIL or a trusted friend come over during the day so you and your wife can nap simultaneously?\n2.  **External Help:** If you can afford it, look into a **postpartum doula** or a **night nurse** for a few nights a week. They are specifically trained to handle the night feedings and allow parents to sleep. This is often an essential bridge to recovery.\n3.  **Lower the Bar:** Forget about the house, chores, and perfect routines. For the next month, the only goals are: feed the baby, change the baby, and get sleep. Order takeout, use disposable plates, and let the laundry pile up.\n\n### B. Focus on Treatment\n\n1.  **Attend those appointments.** Be completely transparent. You need to explore medication (if appropriate) and therapy for both of you to stabilize your mood and anxiety.\n2.  **Talk to your wife about PPA/PPD.** Acknowledge that the mean things you might be saying to each other are the anxiety talking, not your true feelings. Reiterate that you miss her and are in this fight together.\n\n### C. Revisit the Question in 6\u20138 Weeks\n\nYou asked, \"How and when do we know if it's time for adoption?\"\n\n**The time to seriously consider this question is *after* you have received professional mental health treatment, had several weeks of improved sleep, and accessed significant support.**\n\nIf, after 6\u20138 weeks of dedicated treatment for anxiety and depression, and with stable sleep, you still feel this overwhelming sense of dread, failure, and certainty that you cannot provide your daughter with a loving life, *then* you can begin to explore the difficult, complex options of adoption with a professional social worker or counselor.\n\n**For now, focus on the next 24 hours: Get help, and get some sleep.**\n\nYou are doing the right thing by seeking help. Please keep talking, either here or with your doctor and therapist. You are not alone in this feeling."
