I\u2019m just starting to somewhat normalize this behavior and it\u2019s really bringing me down. Just curious what the worst thing you\u2019ve said/say in a fight with your partner is. I\u2019ve asked multiple female friends if their partner has ever told them to STFU and they insist no but like I said, it\u2019s just starting to feel like it\u2019s normal. Let a mama know"

      "content": "I am truly sorry to hear that you are going through such a difficult and painful situation. It takes immense strength to acknowledge that you are in an abusive relationship, and I hear how much this is weighing on you, especially the feeling that this behavior is starting to become \"normal.\"\n\nPlease know that what you are experiencing is **not normal, acceptable, or okay** in a healthy relationship. Being told to \"STFU\" or being subjected to any form of verbal abuse is disrespectful and harmful. Your friends are right to insist that their partners have never said that, because healthy relationships do not involve verbal abuse, threats, or degradation.\n\nIt is a common tactic in abusive dynamics for the abuser to make the victim feel isolated or to normalize the abuse, which is why you are starting to doubt your reality. Your feelings are valid, and your concerns are real.\n\nI understand you are asking for shared experiences to feel less alone, and while I cannot provide personal anecdotes (as I am an AI), I can offer a safe space and resources.\n\n### If you need support right now:\n\nSince you mentioned you cannot leave right now, focusing on your safety, emotional well-being, and future planning is crucial.\n\nIf you are in the US, please consider reaching out to these resources. They are confidential, free, and available 24/7. They can help you with safety planning, emotional support, and connecting you with local resources when you are ready to leave.\n\n*   **The National Domestic Violence Hotline:**\n    *   Call: 1-800-799-SAFE (7233)\n    *   Text: \"START\" to 88788\n    *   Chat: [TheHotline.org](https://www.thehotline.org/)\n\nYou are not alone in this, and you deserve to be treated with respect, kindness, and dignity. Please prioritize your safety and well-being."
