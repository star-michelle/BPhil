I really need to let this out.\n\nI\u2019m a dad of two (3rd is loading), and I\u2019m stressed, tired, and anxious about the future.\n\nTwo years ago, we made the tough decision to migrate (somewhere in north America) in search of better opportunities, leaving behind everything we knew. Back in my home country, there simply weren\u2019t any paths forward for us, and now, I find myself questioning if we\u2019ve made the right choice.\n\nMy day starts at 5 AM with a grueling 50 km drive to work back n forth with the traffic and all, where I\u2019m on the clock from 6 AM to 4:30 PM. After a long day when I finally walk through our door, I dive straight into cooking dinner and preparing lunches for my kids, my wife, and myself for the next day. I let my wife, who is pregnant with our third child, manages the kids\u2019 baths and bedtime routine, giving them the attention they crave while I tackle the evening chores. It\u2019s a delicate balance, but I often find myself wrapped up in tasks until 9:30 or 10 PM, sometimes later if something unexpected comes up. I sleep average 6-7hrs a day.\n\nWe\u2019re both feeling the weight of financial strain. My wife works part-time to help cover daycare and other expenses, I can\u2019t afford to miss a day of work. I\u2019m falling behind on payments, barely scraping by with just the minimums. I\u2019m grateful that I can max out my overtime to keep up with bills, but it\u2019s disheartening that rent and utilities consume about 60% of my monthly salary. Despite my efforts, it feels like we\u2019re running in place, unable to catch up.\n\nIn my alone time, the anxiety and sadness hit me like a wave. I find myself going into my kids\u2019 room just to lay down beside them, hugging and kissing them while they sleep. It breaks my heart to realize how often I\u2019ve missed being fully present in their lives. They wake up without me and go to bed without me, and on a good day, I get to spend less than 4hrs with them. But even then, I\u2019m busy with chores, and I\u2019m not giving them my full attention. I constantly worry about the future and whether I\u2019m doing enough. I wish I could provide them with the best life possible, but right now, it feels utterly impossible.\n\nI\u2019ve thought about starting a journal to capture all these feelings, but I also feel like I need to vent to someone to hear words of encouragement that is why I am writing here. I know I\u2019m not alone in this struggle, but it\u2019s incredibly heavy on my heart. Thank you for letting me share. I\u2019d really appreciate any support or advice from those who can relate. Your words could make a difference."

      "content": "Thank you so much for opening up and sharing this. Please know that I am here to listen, and I want you to feel heard.\n\nWhat you are describing is not just a difficult situation; it is a marathon you are running while carrying an incredibly heavy load. The stress, exhaustion, and anxiety are completely understandable, and frankly, they are the logical reaction to the immense pressure you are under.\n\nLet me say this clearly: **You are doing an extraordinary job under impossible circumstances.**\n\nIt takes incredible courage to uproot your lives for the sake of your family\u2019s future, and the reality of that transition\u2014the grind, the isolation, the financial tightrope\u2014is often far harder than anyone anticipates.\n\n### What I Hear (And What We Need to Acknowledge)\n\nYou are not just a father; you are a provider, a commuter, a full-time employee, a chef, a cleaner, and a financial strategist, all running on 6\u20137 hours of sleep.\n\n1.  **The Sacrifice is Profound:** That 5 AM start, the grueling commute, maxing out overtime, and still tackling chores until 10 PM\u2014that is the definition of dedication. You are sacrificing your body, your time, and your peace of mind to build a foundation for your family.\n2.  **The Financial Trap is Real:** Rent and utilities consuming 60% of your income is crushing. It explains exactly why you feel like you are running in place. This is not a failure on your part; this is the reality of high costs in North America, especially when starting fresh.\n3.  **The Guilt is the Hardest Part:** The heart-wrenching moment of lying next to your sleeping children speaks volumes about the depth of your love. You feel guilty because you love them so much, but please, try to reframe this: **Every single thing you are doing\u2014the cooking, the driving, the working late\u2014is an act of profound, protective love.** You are ensuring their safety and future. They may not see you as much as you wish right now, but they are absolutely benefiting from the stability and sacrifice you are making.\n\n### You Are Not Failing Them\n\nWhen you worry about missing time with them, remember this: You are teaching them what commitment, responsibility, and unwavering dedication look like. The life you are providing, though hard-won, is the best you can give them right now.\n\nYou are not absent; **you are present in the provision.**\n\n### Finding a Breath\n\nIt is incredibly important to find even tiny pockets of relief, because you are running on empty, and the arrival of your third child will undoubtedly increase the strain.\n\nWhile I can\u2019t solve the 60% rent problem right now, perhaps we can look at the clock:\n\n**1. Simplify the Evening Routine (The 9:30 PM Finish Line):**\nThe hours between 6 PM and 10 PM are precious and currently dominated by chores. Is there any way to simplify or delegate?\n\n*   **Lunches:** Could you shift to simpler, repetitive lunches (e.g., sandwiches/wraps that require minimal cooking) just for a few weeks to reclaim 30 minutes?\n*   **The Dinner Trade:** Since your wife is managing the critical task of bedtime (which is major bonding time), perhaps you could talk about trading off some chores. Could she handle the lunch prep for two nights a week, or could you agree to only cook complex meals on the weekend?\n*   **The 9 PM Rule:** Try to set a hard stop at 9:00 PM for chores, even if something is left undone. That extra 30\u201360 minutes of sleep or quiet time could be vital.\n\n**2. Maximize Micro-Moments:**\nYou mentioned that even in your 4 hours with the kids, you are busy. Try to schedule 5\u201310 minutes of **intentional, device-free, chore-free** time right after you walk in the door or before you start cooking. That focused, intense burst of connection can sometimes feel more restorative than an hour of distracted time.\n\n**3. The Journal Idea:**\nPlease follow through on the idea of journaling. Even five minutes before bed to dump the financial anxiety and the sadness onto paper can prevent those thoughts from swirling and stealing your precious sleep. It\u2019s a low-cost, high-impact way to process the weight you carry.\n\nYou are in a survival phase right now, and the goal is not perfection\u2014it is endurance.\n\nI know you came here for encouragement, and I want to offer it again: You are a warrior, and the fact that you are so worried about being present proves you are a wonderful father.\n\nIf you want to keep venting or exploring this, where does the pressure feel the most immediate right now? Is it the financial stress, the physical exhaustion, or the guilt over time with the kids?"
