We\u2019re breastfeeding and it just doesn\u2019t seem to be going right all though my son is putting on plenty of weight. He cries, all the time. Inconsolable crying that goes on and on and on. We\u2019ve tried winding and walking and music and car rides and pram walks and Infacol. He just doesn\u2019t stop. Today he started crying at 0500 and the only time he stopped between then and now (1530) is when he was on the boob. \n\nOur midwife keeps saying it will get easier and that things will calm down but it just doesn\u2019t seem that way at all and to top it all off my wife is now showing signs of mastitis. \n\nHow did you guys cope??

      "content": "This sounds incredibly exhausting, overwhelming, and frankly, heartbreaking. Please know that what you are describing is a **huge** amount to cope with, and it is completely valid to feel like this is too hard.\n\nTo answer your initial question: **Is it supposed to be this hard?**\n\nWhile parenting newborns is universally challenging, the level of constant, inconsolable crying you are describing, especially when coupled with your wife's potential mastitis and the lack of relief, sounds like you are deep in the trenches of a particularly difficult period. It is absolutely understandable why you are struggling.\n\nIt sounds like you are doing everything you can to soothe him\u2014trying all the common tricks like walking, music, car rides, and Infacol. You are being incredibly attentive parents.\n\nLet's break down what you've shared and then talk about coping strategies:\n\n***\n\n### 1. The Crying (Inconsolable and Constant)\n\nThe fact that your son cries almost non-stop unless he is actively feeding, and that this has been going on since early May, suggests something more than just typical newborn fussiness.\n\n**Since he is gaining weight well, that is a huge positive sign** that he is getting enough nutrition, which can rule out some major concerns. However, the crying itself needs attention, both for his comfort and for your mental health.\n\n**It might be helpful to discuss a few specific possibilities with your healthcare provider (GP, pediatrician, or even a lactation consultant) as soon as possible:**\n\n*   **Colic:** Colic is defined as crying for more than three hours a day, for more than three days a week, for three weeks or more. It sounds like you are exceeding this definition. While the cause is often unknown, sometimes dietary sensitivities (like a cow's milk protein allergy/intolerance, or CMPA/CMPI) can present this way, even in breastfed babies.\n*   **Reflux (GERD):** If he seems uncomfortable, arches his back, or is only comfortable upright while feeding, it might be reflux, even if he's not spitting up large amounts (sometimes called \"silent reflux\").\n*   **Overtiredness:** Ironically, constant crying can make it harder for babies to sleep, leading to a cycle of overtiredness and more crying.\n\n**Action Step:** Since your midwife's advice (\"it will get easier\") isn't proving helpful right now, you need more immediate, specific support. **Call your GP or pediatrician tomorrow** and explain the severity of the crying (e.g., \"He cried non-stop for 10.5 hours today, only stopping while actively feeding\"). Ask them to evaluate him for reflux or possible sensitivities.\n\n***\n\n### 2. Mastitis and Supporting Your Wife\n\nMastitis is serious, painful, and requires immediate attention, especially when you are already dealing with exhaustion.\n\n**Mastitis symptoms usually include:** a painful, hot, or red area on the breast, flu-like symptoms (chills, fever, body aches), and feeling generally unwell.\n\n**Action Step:** **Your wife needs to call the GP immediately** if she is showing these signs. If it is mastitis, she will likely need antibiotics quickly, and she will need to keep the breast draining (often by feeding frequently or pumping), which is incredibly painful when unwell.\n\n***\n\n### 3. How Did We Cope? (Practical and Emotional Support)\n\nThis is the hardest part. When you are running on empty, survival mode is the only mode. Here are strategies people use to get through periods like this:\n\n#### **A. Survival Strategy (The 5-Minute Rule)**\n\nWhen the crying is relentless, it is a risk factor for parental stress and anger. You need a safe, immediate exit strategy.\n\n*   **Take Turns:** If your wife is dealing with mastitis, you need to take over the primary soothing role as much as possible, even if it doesn't work.\n*   **The Safe Put-Down:** If you feel yourself reaching a breaking point (frustrated, angry, overwhelmed), **put the baby down safely in the crib or bassinet, and walk away for five minutes.** He is safe. He is crying because he is uncomfortable, not because you are a bad parent. Taking five minutes to breathe, splash water on your face, or scream into a pillow is crucial for regulation.\n\n#### **B. Divide and Conquer**\n\nSince the baby only stops crying on the breast, your wife is likely trapped. You need to create protected time for her to rest and recover, especially with the potential mastitis.\n\n*   **\"Shift Work\":** Establish short, dedicated shifts where the *other* parent is completely off duty. For example, \"I will take the baby from 7 PM to 10 PM, and you go to bed. I will only wake you if he absolutely needs a feed.\" Even three hours of uninterrupted rest can be restorative.\n*   **The \"Boob Break\":** When the baby is done feeding, take him immediately. Hold him, walk him, bounce him, wear him in a carrier\u2014anything to give your wife 30 minutes to shower, eat a hot meal, or just sit in silence.\n\n#### **C. Get External Help (Crucial)**\n\nYou cannot do this alone, especially when dealing with medical issues and severe crying.\n\n1.  **Medical Support:** As mentioned, insist on a full evaluation for colic/reflux/allergies.\n2.  **Lactation Support:** If the breastfeeding feels \"not right,\" a **private Lactation Consultant (IBCLC)** can observe a feed and check for issues like tongue tie, poor latch, or positioning that might be contributing to gas/unrest.\n3.  **Physical Support:** If you have family, friends, or neighbors nearby, use them. They don't need to soothe the baby (because let's face it, no one can right now). They need to bring you food, clean your kitchen, or watch the baby while he is sleeping (if he ever does) so both of you can nap.\n\n#### **D. Manage Expectations**\n\nRight now, your only goal is survival.\n\n*   **Lower the Bar:** Forget cleaning, elaborate meals, or answering non-essential emails. If everyone is fed and safe, you have succeeded.\n*   **Acknowledge the Pain:** This is a period of intense pain and struggle. It is okay to admit that this is the hardest thing you have ever done. Don't let the societal pressure of \"newborn bliss\" make you feel guilty for struggling.\n\n**Please prioritize getting immediate medical support for your wife's potential mastitis and insisting on a thorough evaluation for your son's crying.** You deserve clarity and practical help right now.\n\n**How are you feeling about reaching out to your GP or pediatrician tomorrow?**"
