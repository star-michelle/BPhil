This isn\u2019t the first time she has freaked out or the first time she has hit me in the face. She\u2019s close to 3 now. She has always been more drawn to her mom and it\u2019s not like this all the time but she only does it to me. \n\nRight now my MIL is here and it\u2019s always worse when she\u2019s staying with us. My daughter loves my MIL. She helped us out for the first 8 months of my daughters life because we both work, so she is very close with her grandma. \n\nThe problem is I hate this woman. Absolutely hate her. My daughter would not exist if she had gotten her way 10+ years ago. She tried repeatedly to break us up. She and my FIL would not give their blessing when I asked to marry their daughter and went no contact for a year trying to pressure my wife into choosing them over me. \n\nSo it\u2019s extra hard to see my daughter unconditionally love my MIL while I\u2019m getting hit in the face. I don\u2019t know what I did wrong. I don\u2019t know why my daughter is so mean to me. My wife is so confused as well. \n\nIt breaks my heart though. I love this girl more than life itself and when she does this it makes me extremely depressed. \n\nHelp me dads. I\u2019m feeling very lost and crushed right now."

      "content": "This is incredibly hard, and I want to start by validating everything you are feeling. What you are experiencing right now is a perfect storm of developmental frustration, personal emotional trauma, and deep-seated resentment.\n\nPlease take a moment and breathe: **You are not doing anything wrong. You are a loving father, and your daughter loves you.**\n\nThe feeling of betrayal and rejection when the person you love most hits you\u2014especially when you are already carrying the baggage of your MIL\u2019s past actions\u2014is crushing. It\u2019s completely understandable that you feel lost and depressed.\n\nLet\u2019s break down the three distinct issues at play here, because while they feel connected, they require separate approaches.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Immediate Behavior: Why She Hits and What to Do\n\nFirst, let's address the 3-year-old behavior.\n\n### Why She Hits *You*\n\nWhen a child is close to three, they have huge feelings (tiredness, overstimulation, frustration, confusion) but almost no ability to articulate them effectively. They lash out because they lack the verbal skills to say, \"I am overwhelmed right now,\" or \"I don't want to leave Grandma.\"\n\nWhen a child consistently targets one parent, it is usually for one of two reasons:\n\n1.  **You are the Safe Space:** Children often save their worst behavior for the person they feel safest with. They know that no matter how big their meltdown is, you won't leave them. They trust you enough to handle their biggest, ugliest emotions. **This is actually a sign of deep attachment, not rejection.**\n2.  **You are the Boundary Setter:** If you are often the parent who enforces the rules (e.g., \"Time to leave the park,\" \"No, we can't have another cookie\"), you become the target of the frustration.\n\n### What to Do in the Moment\n\nConsistency is key, especially when dealing with aggression. Hitting must have an immediate, predictable consequence.\n\n1.  **Safety First:** If she hits your face, your primary response is to protect yourself and stop the physical contact immediately.\n2.  **Immediate Disengagement (The Boundary):** Firmly (but calmly) set her down, or walk away from her, even if you are in the middle of picking her up.\n3.  **The Clear, Simple Script:** Use minimal words, delivered calmly. \"Hands are not for hitting. If you hit, I will put you down.\" Or, \"I won't let you hit me.\"\n4.  **No Emotional Reaction:** This is the hardest part. Toddlers are seeking a reaction\u2014any reaction. If you get angry, sad, or yell, you are reinforcing the behavior (even negative attention is attention). Try to remain a dull, firm wall. Once she is calm, you can talk about feelings, but not while she is hitting.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Emotional Overlay: The MIL Factor\n\nThis is the part that is breaking your heart, and rightfully so. You have historical trauma with this woman, and seeing your daughter bond with her while rejecting you feels like the ultimate injustice.\n\n### Why the MIL\u2019s Presence Makes It Worse\n\nYou mentioned that the hitting is worse when your MIL is there. This is likely due to a combination of factors:\n\n1.  **Overstimulation/Schedule Disruption:** Visits, especially long ones, disrupt a 3-year-old\u2019s routine, which is a massive trigger for meltdowns.\n2.  **Emotional Sponging:** Toddlers are masters at picking up on tension. Even if you and your wife are consciously avoiding conflict, your internal stress, your resentment toward the MIL, and the general tension in the house are palpable to your daughter. This increased stress makes her more likely to lash out.\n3.  **Grief and Jealousy:** You are experiencing profound jealousy and grief. It\u2019s painful to watch the unconditional love you crave being given to the person who tried to hurt you. This is a real, valid feeling, and you need to acknowledge it.\n\n### Action Plan for the MIL Situation\n\nThis is a conversation you need to have with your wife when you are both calm.\n\n*   **Acknowledge the Tension:** Explain that while you appreciate the help, the tension caused by the visits seems to be negatively impacting your daughter\u2019s behavior and your mental health.\n*   **Set Boundaries for Visits:** Can the visits be shorter? Can the MIL stay in a nearby hotel instead of in your home? You and your wife need to agree on boundaries that protect your family unit and your mental well-being.\n*   **Consistency Between Caregivers:** When the MIL is present, ensure all three adults (you, your wife, and your MIL) are using the *exact same script* and reaction when the aggression occurs. If your MIL coddles the behavior or tries to mediate, it undermines your efforts.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Your Relationship and Mental Health\n\nYour daughter\u2019s behavior is making you extremely depressed, which is a serious concern. You need to prioritize your own well-being.\n\n### Reconnect During Calm Moments\n\nYou cannot force a child to prefer you, but you can build positive associations that flood her system with good feelings about you.\n\n*   **The 15-Minute Rule:** Dedicate 15 minutes a day (or more) of focused, uninterrupted, **child-led play** with your daughter. No phones, no MIL, no wife. Get on the floor and let her direct the play. This builds up her \"love tank\" for you and strengthens your bond outside of stressful moments (like pick-up time).\n*   **The Power of Connection Before Transition:** If she often melts down at pickup, spend 3-5 minutes connecting with her *before* you try to transition her out the door. A quick cuddle, a silly game, or a simple observation (\"Wow, you built a tall tower!\") can help ease the shift and reduce the likelihood of a stress response.\n\n### Seek Support for Yourself\n\nThe hatred you feel for your MIL is deep, and it\u2019s affecting your ability to parent in peace. It\u2019s hard to separate the historical pain from the current moment.\n\n*   **Talk to a professional.** A therapist can help you process the historical trauma and the complex grief of watching your daughter bond with someone you resent. Learning strategies to manage your internal stress will create a calmer environment for your daughter.\n*   **Talk to your wife.** She is your partner. You need her understanding and consistent support in managing both the MIL situation and the hitting behavior. You two must be a united front.\n\nYou are a great dad who is facing a difficult situation. Keep setting those firm, loving boundaries, and remember that this phase of aggression will pass. Focus on strengthening the beautiful, loving bond you share with her during the peaceful moments."
