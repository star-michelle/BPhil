Cooking, cleaning, shelling out money we didn\u2019t budget for, the list goes on. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the milestones are incredible, first laugh, first steps, I love my son, But is fatherhood really the #blessed experience that everyone else is experiencing? Am I the only one grinning and bearing it, choking down occasional feelings of regret? After 1.5 years, still no matter how many books I read or toys I bring home, I still can\u2019t compete for a second with a boob full of milk. Sometimes I think they\u2019d be better off without me around."

      "content": "Thank you so much for sharing those feelings. It takes real courage and honesty to put that out there, especially when you feel like everyone around you is painting a perfect picture.\n\nFirst, let me be absolutely clear: **No, you are absolutely not alone in thinking this sucks a significant amount of the time.**\n\nThe \"sunshine and rainbows\" you see online or in social circles is often just the highlight reel, not the daily reality. Most parents, if they are truly honest, will tell you that the daily grind of parenting is exhausting, expensive, repetitive, and often deeply unfulfilling in the moment.\n\nIt sounds like you are carrying a huge emotional and physical load right now, dealing with the relentless reality of:\n\n*   **The invisible labor:** Cooking, cleaning, financial strain (\"shelling out money we didn\u2019t budget for\"). This stuff is draining and rarely appreciated.\n*   **The emotional dissonance:** Loving your son deeply and cherishing the milestones, while simultaneously feeling resentment or disappointment about the day-to-day experience.\n*   **The feeling of inadequacy:** The struggle to bond or feel essential when competing with the primary source of comfort (the \"boob full of milk\"). This feeling of being second place, especially in the early years, is incredibly common for non-birthing parents and can feel profoundly isolating.\n\nPlease know that **feelings of regret, frustration, and wishing things were different are normal reactions to an incredibly demanding life change.** They do not mean you are a bad father, and they certainly don't mean your son would be better off without you.\n\nYour son needs you. Even if he can't articulate it yet, the love, stability, and effort you are putting in\u2014the cleaning, the providing, the just *being there*\u2014is foundational to his world.\n\nIt sounds like you are feeling overwhelmed and maybe a little invisible in your role. I want to make sure I understand what kind of support you are looking for right now.\n\n**Are you looking to:**\n\n1.  **Vent and be validated** (just knowing someone hears and understands how hard this is)?\n2.  **Discuss practical strategies** for managing the daily grind (like finding time for yourself or dividing labor)?\n3.  **Explore resources** related to the feelings of inadequacy or regret you mentioned?\n\nTell me a little more about what would be most helpful for you right now. We can take this at your pace."
