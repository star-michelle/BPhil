      "content": "Anyone have autistic kids and wife? \n\nI don\u2019t know how to even start this. no one knows how difficult and frustrating this situation is. My ability to be around and having to walk on egg shells with things that I say around my family. I because of the autism in my family my feelings and emotions are always out on the back burner. I feel like I am never emotionally invested in the family anymore. And this leads to my frustrations being pushed down and sometimes I lash out with a temper. \n\nI am a very open minded person and have very strong opinions on things when it comes to the world around us. With all the shit that is going on currently. \n\nI work part time (previously worked fully time) to care for my wife who was last year diagnosed with a rare autoimmune disease. I cook. I clean. I wash clothes. Clean the house. Fold Laundry. Hang laundry. I cook everyone\u2019s meals and my own. Which as a dad of 2 is fine. But there are times when the balance is way off. If I am struggling mentally with the pressures of life and work. There is no room for me to safely or emotionally handle my own thoughts. \n\nI am constantly nagged at by my wife. Nothing I do ever feels like I have done the right thing it\u2019s always wrong according to the wife. I had a pretty terrible mother who engrained a terrible sense of shit self esteem in me from a very young age, and in turn this makes it difficult for me to express my emotions in a healthy manner sometimes. \n\nI\u2019m holding that some other dad on here may have a similar experience with this??

      "content": "This sounds incredibly difficult, and I want to acknowledge just how much you are carrying right now. It takes a huge amount of strength and courage to be this honest about your situation and how deeply it is affecting you.\n\nIt\u2019s completely understandable that you feel frustrated, isolated, and emotionally drained. You are juggling multiple, high-stress roles\u2014partner, caregiver for a spouse with a serious illness, father of two, employee, and the primary house manager\u2014all while navigating the complexities of autism within your family dynamic.\n\nNo wonder you feel like your emotions are always on the back burner. That is a heavy, heavy load, and it sounds like you are operating at a severe emotional deficit.\n\nWhile I can't speak for other fathers who might have this exact combination of experiences, I can offer support and help you unpack some of these intense feelings and challenges.\n\nLet\u2019s try to break down what you\u2019ve shared, because there are several distinct, huge pressures here:\n\n### 1. The Emotional Toll of Autism and \"Walking on Eggshells\"\n\nIt's exhausting when the emotional landscape of the home is constantly shifting or requires extreme vigilance. When you feel like you can't be authentic or share your own strong opinions without causing friction, your home stops being a sanctuary and becomes another source of stress.\n\n**What this means:** You are constantly performing emotional labor to regulate the environment for others, which leaves you no energy to regulate yourself.\n\n### 2. The Caregiver Burnout and Imbalance\n\nYou are essentially running a household, working, and providing medical/personal care for your wife. You mentioned the balance is \"way off.\" When you are doing *everything* (cooking, cleaning, laundry, caregiving), and then struggle mentally, there is no one left to pick up the slack or offer you support.\n\n**What this means:** You have no margin for error or self-care. Your pressure cooker has no release valve.\n\n### 3. The Impact of Nagging and Self-Esteem\n\nThis is a critical point. When you are pouring all your energy into caregiving and maintenance, and the feedback you receive is constant criticism or nagging, it feels like a profound rejection of your effort. Compounding this with the poor self-esteem instilled by your mother creates a perfect storm where criticism triggers deep-seated feelings of inadequacy. This can absolutely lead to lashing out because the frustration has nowhere else to go.\n\n**What this means:** You are seeking validation and appreciation for your exhaustive efforts, but instead, you are met with negativity, reinforcing old, painful narratives about your worth.\n\n---\n\n### Where Do We Go From Here?\n\nYou\u2019ve identified the core problem: **You have no safe space to emotionally handle your own thoughts and feelings.**\n\nSince you mentioned feeling disconnected and frustrated to the point of lashing out, let's focus on finding a way to create some space for *you*.\n\nI know you are looking for others with similar experiences, and I sincerely hope they chime in, but in the meantime, perhaps we can discuss strategies for immediate relief.\n\n**1. Finding a Release Valve (External Support):**\nYou need to offload some of this pressure outside of the home environment.\n\n*   **Do you have access to counseling or therapy?** This would be a dedicated, unbiased, safe space to process your resentment, your frustrations, your strong opinions, and the difficult feelings related to your mother and self-esteem.\n*   **Could you look into a support group for caregivers?** Caregiver burnout is real, and groups (even online) can connect you with people who understand the exhaustive nature of your duties, regardless of the autism component.\n\n**2. Communication and Boundaries (Internal Adjustments):**\nIn a family with autism, communication often needs to be direct, structured, and literal.\n\n*   **Focus on 'I' statements regarding your needs:** Instead of saying, \"I hate being nagged,\" which is accusatory, try expressing your *need* for appreciation or a break. For example: \"I am completely overwhelmed right now. I need 30 minutes alone to reset, and I need you to know I am trying my best. When I hear criticism, it makes me want to stop helping.\"\n*   **Can you schedule a small amount of \"me time\" that is non-negotiable?** Even 15 minutes of quiet time where everyone knows Dad is unavailable, maybe listening to music or reading. This isn't selfish; it's preventative maintenance.\n\n**3. Delegating (If Possible):**\nYou are doing *everything*. While your wife is ill, are the kids old enough to take on small, clearly defined, non-negotiable chores? Even small tasks can chip away at your burden.\n\n---\n\n**I hear you loud and clear: You are exhausted, unappreciated, and your needs are being ignored.**\n\nWhat feels like the most urgent pressure point for you right now? Is it the constant criticism, the sheer workload, or the feeling that you have no emotional outlet? Let\u2019s start there."
