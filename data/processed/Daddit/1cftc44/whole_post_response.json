      "content": "My mother in law spanked my daughter (3Y10M)--my wife and I are resolutely against physical punishment.\n\nTLDR; my daughter had a tantrum while I was at work and my MIL lost control and spanked her even though my wife and I are resolutely anti-corporal punishment. \n\nLately my little girl, I\u2019ll call her E (3Y10M), has become a full-fledged 'threenager.' I posted a while back about my wife worrying about her having a mental condition, but she\u2019s just a willful and stubborn soon-to-be four year old. We\u2019ve adapted to her tantrums and we\u2019ve been figuring out how to redirect her or letting her cool off depending on the degree of tantrum. We\u2019ve been making headway, but grandma is not along for the ride. \n\nMy MIL--who has lived with us since we all got shut in together during COVID--has been getting more and more aggressive with E as she goes through this new phase. My MIL's limited patience has given way to shouting, calling E names and even openly swearing in front of her. My wife has tried her best to get her mom to cut the bullshit, and to get her to take some time away from the house. Frankly, the only reason I haven\u2019t kicked her to the curb myself is because my wife insists that she needs her mom\u2019s help around the house. \n\nWell, last night I was on duty to watch study hall until 10:00 PM (very normal for teachers at boarding schools in our country). My wife messages me that E has been being a pain in the ass that night. Later she tells me that E had a bath but is going into tantrum mode, doesn\u2019t want to put on her pants or underwear and is rolling around on the hard wood floors saying she doesn\u2019t want to be clean. That is clearly an awful situation and I wish I were at home to deal with it. Before I can even type a response message, my wife tells me that my mother in law--who has been told countless times that we are vehemently against physical punishment--bent E over and spanked her. Afterward my wife took E into the bedroom and locked the door. \n\nI won\u2019t go into a play by play of how our conversation went or how her conversation with her mom went. I want to throw this horrible woman out on her ass, but my wife has asked me to let her deal with it. My MIL says that she is beside herself with regret and admits that she lost control and says it will never happen again. My wife and MIL\u00a0took her out of preschool so that grandma can \u2018make it up to E\u2019 today by taking her to the play place and buying her some toys. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal though; she lost control. The very fact that she used\u00a0that language shows me that if she is allowed to watch my daughter any more then there will always be a risk of this happening again. Also the \u2018making it up to E\u2019 strikes me as the kind of behavior a domestic abuser would display--you know, apologizing and suddenly behaving like a saint after clocking their partner. I am almost certain that if she stays in the house then this will happen again, but my wife says I need to have more faith in her and her family. \n\nSo here\u2019s my rock and a hard place: I want this woman out of my house immediately for the safety and welfare of my daughter, but my wife has specifically asked me to let her handle it. She is handling it by giving her mom a second chance, which sees me worried that my daughter will experience more of this kind of what I would frankly call abuse and my wife and I\u00a0will see more casual disregard for our\u00a0parenting ethics.\n\nHow do I navigate this? Has anyone had any similar experience?"

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult and painful situation, and I want to start by validating everything you are feeling\u2014the anger, the betrayal, and the deep, protective fear for your daughter. Your reaction is completely justified. When a clear, non-negotiable boundary regarding the physical safety of a child is crossed, especially by someone living in the home, it immediately elevates the situation to a crisis point.\n\nIt sounds like you are caught between the absolute necessity of protecting your daughter and the very real need to support your wife and respect her process of dealing with her mother. Let's break down how to navigate this conflict by focusing on safety first, and then addressing the relationship dynamics.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Validating Your Safety Concerns\n\nYou are absolutely right to focus on the MIL\u2019s phrase, **\"I lost control.\"**\n\nWhen someone loses control and crosses a major ethical boundary (like physical punishment, especially after being explicitly told not to), the apology, while potentially sincere, does not erase the risk. Your concern that this is a pattern\u2014similar to the \"honeymoon phase\" often seen after abuse\u2014is a serious and valid interpretation.\n\nThe issue isn't whether your MIL *regrets* the action; the issue is that she has demonstrated she is **unable to adhere to your family's core parenting rules during stress.** This inability, combined with the escalating pattern of shouting and name-calling, means the risk remains high.\n\nThe \"making it up to E\" gesture, while intended to soothe the child, further muddies the waters by making the boundary violation transactional (a spank equals a new toy). This undermines your family\u2019s ethical stance and teaches E that physical pain can be instantly erased by material goods.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Navigating the Conflict with Your Wife\n\nYour wife is asking for faith and space to handle her mother. This is a crucial request, but it cannot override the safety of your child. Your goal now is to shift the conversation from *whether* the MIL should be given a second chance to *what conditions* must be immediately put in place to ensure E's safety while your wife figures out the next steps.\n\nHere is how you can approach the conversation with your wife:\n\n### A. Define Non-Negotiable Boundaries (Immediate Safety Plan)\n\nYou must communicate clearly that while you respect her desire to handle her mother, **the safety of E is a shared, non-negotiable priority.**\n\n**The absolute minimum requirement for your MIL to remain in the house is this:**\n\n> **The MIL cannot, under any circumstances, be alone with E.**\n\nThis is not a punishment for the MIL; it is a safety protocol based on a demonstrated risk assessment. If she cannot adhere to this rule, she cannot remain in the home. This rule must be enforced immediately, starting today.\n\n### B. Frame the Conversation Around Risk, Not Blame\n\nWhen you talk to your wife, focus on the facts and the risk assessment, not on calling her mother a \"horrible woman\" (even if that\u2019s how you feel).\n\n*   **Instead of:** \"We have to kick your mom out because she abused E.\"\n*   **Try:** \"I understand you want to give her a second chance, but based on the fact that she lost control and crossed a boundary we set up for E's physical safety, we have a demonstrated risk in our home. Until we have a long-term plan, we must implement an immediate safety protocol: she cannot be alone with E. Her regret is important, but it doesn't change the fact that she is currently a safety risk when stressed.\"\n\n### C. Address the \"Need for Help\"\n\nYour wife insists she needs her mother's help. You need to clarify that the \"help\" is now actively causing more harm and stress than it is alleviating.\n\n*   **Ask:** \"What specific help is she providing that is worth the risk of her physically harming E again? We need to evaluate if the emotional and physical cost of having her here outweighs the benefit of having her help with chores. If her presence requires us to constantly monitor her interaction with E, she is no longer providing 'help,' she is creating an additional burden and a significant risk.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Developing a Long-Term Strategy\n\nYour wife needs to understand that \"handling it\" means developing a concrete, time-bound plan for the MIL's departure, or at the very least, a complete restructuring of the living situation.\n\n### 1. Set a Timeline for Re-Evaluation\n\nTell your wife you will respect her request to handle the situation *for a specific, limited time period* (e.g., 30 days), but during that time, you need a clear, joint plan.\n\n*   **The Plan Must Include:** What resources the MIL will use to find a new place (since she has been living there since COVID, she may be dependent), and a firm date for when the discussion about permanent living arrangements will be finalized.\n\n### 2. Mandatory Boundaries Training\n\nIf your wife insists on a second chance, the MIL must agree to professional intervention to stay. This is not about apologizing; it is about demonstrating a commitment to change behavior.\n\n*   **Suggestion:** The MIL must agree to attend counseling or parenting classes focused on stress management, emotional regulation, and non-corporal discipline techniques. This needs to be a mandatory condition for her remaining in the home, even on a temporary basis. *Note: If she refuses, your wife will have a clearer path forward in asking her to leave.*\n\n### 3. United Front\n\nThis incident has exposed a rift in your parenting unit regarding how seriously you take the MIL's actions. You and your wife must be fully aligned on the non-negotiable nature of your parenting ethics.\n\nHave a difficult conversation where you state clearly: \"I need to know we are 100% united that hitting E is unacceptable, and that your priority is E's safety above your mother's comfort or feelings. If you cannot guarantee her safety, I cannot step back and wait.\"\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Action\n\n1.  **Immediate Safety Protocol:** The MIL cannot be alone with E. This is effective immediately and is non-negotiable.\n2.  **Joint Meeting with Wife:** Schedule a formal time to talk (not during a crisis). Focus on the risk assessment and the need for a long-term exit strategy.\n3.  **Mandatory Intervention:** If she stays temporarily, the MIL must agree to counseling/training to address the loss of control and escalation tactics (shouting, name-calling, etc.).\n4.  **Set a Timeline:** Agree on a date (e.g., 30 days) for when the MIL's future living arrangements will be finalized."
