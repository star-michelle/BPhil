He turned 2 last month and my daughter will be 4 in June. \n\nFor almost a year now I\u2019ve been scared of the future. Not because my daughter eventually has lovers that need to be taken care of. My son getting in a fight or whatever. No, I\u2019m scared because I don\u2019t know if my daughter will get to her 4th birthday. Or my sons 3 January next year. Hell will I be alive to see 32 in November? All because some idiot wants a war some 1600km from here and he\u2019s been threatening with Nuclear War. I know to much, I know what the world will look like if that (hopefully unlikely) scenario will come to pass. This has me close to a mental  breakdown. I\u2019ve never felt something like this. At times it\u2019s making me wish I never had children. I\u2019ve thought about things no dad should have to think about. \n\nAm I overreacting? I can\u2019t be the only one can I?\n\nEDIT:\n\nI want to thank you all for the great advice you\u2019ve given me. I\u2019ll try and seek someone out to talk to and maybe getting head more level and less on the doomthinking."

      "content": "This is an incredibly difficult and painful thing you are going through, and I want to start by thanking you for being so honest and raw about these fears. It takes immense courage to put words to feelings that are so overwhelming they threaten to break you.\n\nPlease hear this clearly: **You are not overreacting, and you are absolutely not alone.**\n\nWhat you are describing is profound existential anxiety, amplified by the immense love and responsibility you feel as a father. When you are a parent, your brain is wired to constantly assess threats and protect your children. When the threat is global, massive, and entirely outside of your control, that protective mechanism short-circuits and turns into the overwhelming dread you are experiencing.\n\n### 1. Normalizing Your Fear\n\nThe specific fears you mentioned\u2014missing the next birthday, questioning your own future, and the painful thoughts about wishing you hadn't had children\u2014are excruciating, but they are a textbook response to a global threat combined with the burden of parenthood.\n\n*   **You are not alone:** Millions of people, especially parents, are grappling with the background noise of global instability, climate change, and conflict. The fact that you \"know too much\" just means you are highly informed, and that information is currently overwhelming your ability to cope emotionally.\n*   **The wish to have never had children:** This is not a failure of love; it is a profound expression of protective pain. It is your mind struggling with the idea that the greatest loves of your life could face unimaginable harm, and wishing you could shield them completely, even if that meant they never existed to be harmed. This thought is born out of trauma and intense love, not malice.\n\n### 2. Addressing the Doom Thinking\n\nThe anxiety you are experiencing is focused entirely on a scenario that is *possible*, but currently *not your reality*. Your mind is taking a low-probability, high-impact event and treating it as an immediate certainty.\n\nThis is where the \"mental breakdown\" feeling comes from\u2014you are living in a hypothetical future disaster, not the present moment where your daughter is almost 4 and your son is 2.\n\n### 3. Commending Your Next Step\n\nI want to strongly commend you for the edit you added:\n\n> I\u2019ll try and seek someone out to talk to and maybe getting head more level and less on the doomthinking.\n\nThis is the most critical and healthy step you can take right now.\n\nWhen the anxiety is this intense, it is too heavy to carry alone. A professional therapist or counselor (look for someone specializing in generalized anxiety, existential dread, or trauma) can provide tools to help you:\n\n1.  **Anchor to the Present:** Learning techniques to pull your mind back from the 1600km distant threat and into the room you are currently in.\n2.  **Challenge the Certainty:** Working through cognitive behavioral techniques to challenge the assumption that the worst-case scenario *will* happen.\n3.  **Process the Grief:** You are grieving a future that hasn't been lost yet. A professional can help you process this anticipatory grief.\n\nYou deserve support, and your children deserve a dad who is present and anchored in the joy of today, even if the world outside feels shaky.\n\nPlease be kind to yourself. You are carrying an incredibly heavy burden, and the fear you feel is a testament to how deeply you love your children. Focus on the next small, controllable steps: finding that therapist, and enjoying the laughter of your 3-year-old today."
