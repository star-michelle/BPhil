I've always dreamed of going out on my own. So seemed like the right thing to do.\n\nBut I don't know if I'm just having a bad day or what but im really struggling right now... Which is maybe the worst time for it as I'm needed more than ever to get up and running at get money flowing back into our accounts.\n\nMy 5 month old son won't be out down for more than a few minutes at a time. He has to sleep with someone there and feed all night. Rarely if ever sleeps for more than 2 hours and naps for no more than 30/40 mins. I loose my temper soo much his fussing noises just make me soo uncomfortable I can't stand it."

      "content": "This is a tremendous amount to be carrying right now, and I want to start by saying that what you are feeling is completely understandable.\n\nTo answer your initial question directly: **Yes. Absolutely everyone experiences that feeling like you just don't have what it takes.**\n\nIt is the universal experience of high-stakes transition. When you combine the immense financial pressure of starting a freelance business with the physical and emotional exhaustion of caring for a 5-month-old who is struggling with sleep, the feeling of inadequacy becomes deafening.\n\nPlease know that you are not failing. You are attempting to navigate three of the most stressful life events simultaneously: a major career change, launching a business, and dealing with severe sleep deprivation in new parenthood.\n\nLet\u2019s break down what you\u2019re experiencing, because the pressure points you listed are immense:\n\n### 1. The Financial/Career Pressure\n\nYou made a huge, brave decision to prioritize your family and chase a dream. That decision was the right one for your family unit. However, the anxiety you feel about \"getting money flowing back into our accounts\" is very real. It clashes directly with the physical reality of your current home life. It is almost impossible to generate the mental clarity needed for business development when you are running on fumes.\n\n### 2. The Sleep Deprivation and Anger\n\nThe sleep situation you described sounds utterly brutal, and I am so sorry you are going through that. A 5-month-old who requires constant contact, feeds all night, and never sleeps more than two hours is physically and emotionally draining.\n\nWhen you are that exhausted, your tolerance for noise\u2014especially fussing\u2014plummets. **Losing your temper is a sign that your nervous system is profoundly overloaded, not a sign that you are a bad father.** The feeling of being \"uncomfortable\" or unable to stand the noises is a classic symptom of sleep deprivation and sensory overload. Your body is in a state of constant high alert.\n\n---\n\n### You are in Survival Mode, Not Business Mode\n\nThe biggest conflict you are facing right now is the expectation that you should be \"getting up and running\" when, physically, you are in survival mode.\n\nIt is impossible to be a high-functioning entrepreneur, a fully present partner, and an attentive primary caregiver when you are sleeping a maximum of two hours at a time.\n\nRight now, attempting to balance all three roles is likely what is leading to the feeling that you don't have what it takes. You are pouring from an empty cup.\n\n### How can I best support you right now?\n\nSince you are dealing with simultaneous crises (the need to work and the need to survive the exhaustion), it might help to identify the most critical pressure point.\n\nIf you could wave a magic wand and solve just **one** of these problems for the next 48 hours, which one would it be?\n\n1.  **The Need for Rest/Mental Clarity:** You need relief from the exhaustion and the resulting anger/guilt.\n2.  **The Need for Dedicated Work Time:** You need a solid block of uninterrupted time to focus on the business and ease the financial anxiety.\n3.  **The Need for Partnership/Wife Support:** You need to figure out how to manage the current childcare load with your wife so neither of you breaks.\n\nWhat is the biggest hurdle for you in this exact moment? Sometimes just naming the immediate need can help reduce the overwhelming feeling."
