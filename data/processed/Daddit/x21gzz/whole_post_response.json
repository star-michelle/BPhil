      "content": "Wife's Insomnia Destroying our Family\n\nWe are really, really struggling. My wife has had horrible insomnia for a long time now, feels like since our 2nd child was born over a year ago (3yr boy, 1yr girl), but it's gotten so bad now. She doesn't get any restful sleep. By 3pm she's completely drained, by 6:30 when she gets home (she's burning herself out at work), she's barely lucid. Maybe twice a week she's able to hold it together long enough to help get the kids fed and in bed by 8pm, but her personality, her ability to function at work, or interact with me or the family, has deteriorated so badly and so rapidly, I honestly fear every day coming home. \n\nAt best she's so out of it that she just passes out on the couch at 6:30. or it might be another night of hell, with me being told everyone hates me, that the kids hate me, that I'm a horrible human being and a liar about everything, even though she can't articulate what I'm lying about. A couple times it's gotten so bad I've had to lock the kids and myself in the bathroom, giving the kids a bath to drown out her screaming at me. Even worse is the fear that she will lie and manipulate those around us to try and take the kids from me.  \n\nI know this isn't my wife. When she's lucid she knows she's sick, she loves our family and wants to get better. This evil has entered her brain and taken root. It's killing her. The worst fear is getting the call that she's been in a wreck or hurt herself in some way, that I will have to explain to our children why Mommy isn't here anymore.\n\nTonight I literally begged, pleaded, yelled and screamed, cried, tried to to everything in my power to get her to agree to get in the car so we could go to urgent care, see a doctor, try to get something just to help her sleep for one night. It's a $75 co-pay with our insurance, they were open, and the kids were at her parents. Just to try and take a step to getting better. She, or rather the evil within her, refused. Wasn't willing to see a doctor to try and feel better tonight.\n\nThis is her pain, her illness, and these are her choices. But I can't deny she isn't the only one being affected by this. I've struggled with my own anxiety and depression, and have sought help for that. I can feel that I've gotten better. She could have chosen to seek help tonight. She wouldn't, said she was afraid. Her toxicity, her words and her behavior scare me. It hurts her, hurts me, hurts our family, and I need my wife back. My kids need their mom. I want to save my family. I don't know what to do."

      "content": "I am so incredibly sorry that you and your family are going through this profound struggle. What you are describing sounds terrifying, exhausting, and heartbreaking. Please know that you are not alone, and it is completely understandable why you feel scared and overwhelmed.\n\nIt is clear that you are fighting fiercely for your family and your wife. The distinction you are making\u2014between your loving wife and the destructive illness\u2014is important, and it validates the immense pain you are feeling watching her suffer and seeing her personality change so drastically.\n\nYou are witnessing the devastating effects of chronic, severe sleep deprivation coupled with what sounds like a serious mental health crisis. When a person is deprived of restful sleep for this long, their cognitive function, emotional regulation, and even their grasp on reality can be severely compromised. The paranoia, the inability to articulate grievances, and the intense verbal abuse are symptoms of a critical health issue, not necessarily who your wife truly is.\n\nWhile you cannot force her to choose treatment, you *can* choose how you protect yourself and your children, and how you approach getting her the help she needs.\n\nHere are steps focusing on immediate safety, triage, and long-term strategy:\n\n---\n\n## 1. Safety First: Protecting Yourself and Your Children\n\nThe situations you described\u2014having to lock yourself and the children in the bathroom to escape her screaming\u2014are signs of an unsafe domestic environment. Protecting your young children from witnessing this extreme abuse and volatility must be your absolute priority.\n\n*   **Create a Safety Plan:** If she escalates to screaming or verbal abuse, you need a clear, rehearsed plan. This plan should involve calmly disengaging and removing the children from the area immediately. This might mean leaving the house (even if just for a drive) or going to a specific safe room (not just the bathroom, but perhaps a bedroom or basement where the door can be closed and locked).\n*   **Document Everything:** Start keeping a detailed, factual journal of her episodes. Note the date, time, specific behaviors (e.g., \"Screamed that I was a liar for 45 minutes,\" \"Passed out on the couch at 6:30 PM,\" \"Refused to go to Urgent Care\"). This documentation is crucial for two reasons:\n    1.  It provides objective evidence for doctors when you seek medical intervention.\n    2.  It serves as critical evidence should her threats about lying to take the children escalate.\n\n## 2. Urgent Professional Intervention\n\nGiven the severity of her behavior (paranoia, aggression, inability to function, and refusal of basic care), this situation has moved beyond typical insomnia and requires immediate medical attention, likely psychiatric.\n\n**What You Can Do Now:**\n\n*   **Contact Her Primary Care Physician (PCP) or OB/GYN:** Since this started after the birth of your second child, call her doctor immediately. You need to speak to a nurse or physician and describe the severity of the **behavioral symptoms** (screaming, paranoia, inability to care for herself, fear of self-harm/accident) and her complete lack of restful sleep. Do not just focus on the sleep; focus on the resulting crisis.\n*   **Consult a Crisis Team:** If you fear for her immediate safety (self-harm, driving while severely impaired) or the safety of the children, you must use emergency resources.\n    *   **Call 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline):** Explain the situation. They can often guide you on local resources, mental health evaluations, and involuntary commitment procedures if she is deemed a danger to herself or others (which her refusal of care and severe impairment suggests is a possibility).\n    *   **Call Local Non-Emergency Police/Mobile Crisis Unit:** In many areas, a Mobile Crisis Unit can come to the home to perform a welfare check and a psychiatric evaluation without involving uniformed police, which can be less frightening for her.\n*   **Seek Advice from a Sleep Specialist/Psychiatrist (For Yourself):** Call a sleep clinic or a psychiatrist and ask for a consultation. Explain that your wife is too ill to come in, but you need advice on how to manage a partner with severe, treatment-resistant insomnia leading to psychosis-like symptoms.\n\n## 3. Focus on Your Own Support\n\nYou are carrying an unbearable burden while managing your own past struggles with anxiety and depression. You cannot save her if you burn out completely.\n\n*   **Prioritize Your Own Therapy:** It is essential that you resume or intensify your own counseling. You need a safe, neutral space to process the emotional abuse you are enduring and the terror you feel.\n*   **Find External Support:** Look into support groups for families dealing with severe mental illness, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or even Al-Anon/Codependents Anonymous (which focuses on setting boundaries when dealing with a loved one who is resisting help).\n*   **Utilize Her Parents/Family:** You mentioned the kids were at her parents tonight. You need to have an honest, direct conversation with her parents about the severity of the crisis. They need to understand that this is a medical emergency that is fundamentally altering her brain chemistry and personality, and their support is critical for childcare and potentially encouraging her to seek help.\n\n## A Final Note on Boundaries\n\nYou begged, pleaded, yelled, and cried tonight to get her to go to the doctor. That effort was born of love, but it was also exhausting and ultimately unsuccessful because she is currently too ill to make rational decisions.\n\nYou cannot save her from this illness; only professional intervention can do that. Your role now is to protect your children, maintain your own health, and facilitate the medical process by seeking professional help, even if she resists it violently.\n\nPlease utilize the resources below. Do not go through this alone.\n\n***\n\n### Immediate Resources\n\n| Service | Number | Purpose |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Suicide & Crisis Lifeline** | **988** | For immediate crisis counseling, guidance on welfare checks, or if you fear she might hurt herself. |\n| **National Domestic Violence Hotline** | **1-800-799-7233** | While the primary cause is illness, her behavior is abusive. They can help you create safety plans and navigate crisis situations involving verbal aggression. |\n| **National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)** | **1-800-950-NAMI (6264)** | Provides support, education, and resources for families dealing with severe mental illness. |"
