Our baby is due in late September, and the one we lost would have been due in May.\n\nFor those of you who haven't experienced it, miscarriage is difficult. I find myself crying and grieving even now, months after our loss.\n\nI know that it's something that just happens, and that nothing we could have done would have prevented it. I'm not seeking validation, just cataloguing my grief.\n\nWhat I did not expect was the news of a second pregnancy to shake me like it has. I'm hopeful and excited and happy, but I'm also terrified of losing this one too. It's brought back the grief over the baby we lost, made it fresh again. And for whatever reason, the knowledge that this baby would not have existed if our last one had survived makes me feel... almost guilty.\n\nAnyway, would love to hear from fellow dads who've lost babies. And prayers and positive vibes for an uneventful full-term pregnancy resulting in a healthy infant would be stellar."

      "content": "Hello, and thank you for reaching out and sharing such a deeply personal and complex situation.\n\nFirst, congratulations on this new pregnancy. That is wonderful news.\n\nSecond, I want to acknowledge the immense strength it takes to navigate this joy while still carrying the weight of your previous loss. What you are feeling\u2014the simultaneous rush of excitement and the paralyzing fear\u2014is incredibly common, and completely understandable.\n\nIt takes courage to hold onto hope after loss, and it\u2019s okay that you are feeling all of these things at once.\n\n### The Complexity of Grief and Joy\n\nYou hit on several very important points that many parents experience after miscarriage, especially when expecting again:\n\n#### 1. The Reactivated Grief and Anxiety\n\nIt makes perfect sense that this news has brought the grief of your first baby back to the surface. Grief doesn't follow a neat timeline; it often resurfaces during milestones or when major life events happen. A new pregnancy is the ultimate milestone.\n\nThe fear you are feeling is essentially **anxiety rooted in experience.** You know what loss feels like now, and your brain is trying desperately to protect you from experiencing that pain again. This blend of hope and terror is so common in subsequent pregnancies after loss that it's often referred to as \"walking the tightrope.\" Please know that your fear is valid, and it\u2019s okay to acknowledge the terror without letting it overshadow the joy entirely.\n\n#### 2. The Guilt of \"Replacement\"\n\nThis feeling of guilt\u2014the thought that this new baby wouldn't exist if the last one had survived\u2014is a powerful and painful emotional knot to untangle.\n\nIt is important to remind yourself, and this may take constant effort, that **this new baby is not a replacement.** They are a completely new, separate individual whose existence does not diminish the love you had for the baby you lost, nor does it make the loss \"worth it.\"\n\nThis feeling of guilt is often tied to the fear that if you fully embrace the joy of the new pregnancy, you are somehow forgetting or dishonoring the baby that came before. That is simply not true. You can hold space for both babies in your heart\u2014one lost, and one growing\u2014without confusing their identities or feeling guilty about the timing.\n\n### Seeking Support\n\nYou are doing the right thing by cataloguing your grief and seeking connection. Many dads find that the second pregnancy is actually harder emotionally than the initial period after the miscarriage, precisely because the stakes feel so high and the anxiety is constant.\n\nIf you are looking for specific ways to manage the anxiety during this time, some things that commonly help dads include:\n\n1.  **Finding Small Milestones:** Instead of focusing on the full nine months, focus on getting through the next week, or the next ultrasound appointment.\n2.  **Talking to Your Partner:** You and your partner are experiencing this simultaneously, though perhaps differently. Ensure you are communicating your fears and anxieties, not just the excitement.\n3.  **Journaling/Writing to the Lost Baby:** Some parents find it helpful to write letters or keep a journal specifically addressed to the baby they lost, affirming their place in the family story, which can sometimes ease the guilt surrounding the new pregnancy.\n\nSending you and your family every positive vibe, prayer, and wish for an incredibly boring, uneventful, full-term pregnancy, resulting in a healthy infant.\n\nPlease feel free to keep sharing how you are feeling, whether it\u2019s the joy, the fear, or the exhaustion of juggling both. We are here to listen."
