      "content": "Advice needed, please. I feel like I'm ruining my relationship with my kids.\n\nThis is from a throwaway account because\u2026well, fuck, I\u2019m just not proud of who I am. I don\u2019t know if this is the right place to ask such advice but, under my normal account, I occasionally lurk here to see all the happy, proud dads and I\u2019m envious. I\u2019m not na\u00efve, I know it\u2019s not all going to be good times and smiles but bad moods, being overwhelmed, anger, and exploding at my kids seem to happen more than the good times. I apologize if this is disjointed or long but part of me just wants to get it out and maybe the details will help with any advice anyone can give. My kids are about to turn five and two and I thought, when my oldest was born, that patience would come with time and experience, like a callous. It hasn\u2019t. Patience has never been my strong suit. In the past I\u2019ve occasionally responded by throwing things and lashing out explosively, though never physically on a person. I\u2019m not proud of that at all but have never known just how to control it. When I had children, I promised to stop reacting like that and have done better, especially in front of them, but not nearly well enough. I\u2019ve also had problems with descending into dark, angry moods. It used to happen every few weeks or months, though now it feels like the norm, four or five days out of the week and usually building up throughout the day. It\u2019s not an excuse but I think it has to do with my ADD. I don\u2019t multitask well because every piece of information coming in gets flagged as important but *not* multitasking is impossible with two children, a wife, life, job, etc. Many days I start off fine, happy, optimistic even, but as the day goes on it gets worse. Thinking and concentrating become harder, like I'm in a deepening fog. I liken it to a room full of people, first one or two are talking, then more, then more, until the din is so loud I have to concentrate heavily to get a solid thought finished or a task accomplished. The feeling of being overwhelmed leads to anger and bad moods. It\u2019s usually then that my patience is shortest and I explode at my kids by yelling at them. Sometimes for legit reasons but usually it could be handled much differently. Because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve experienced, I\u2019ve always believed in limited spanking or corporal punishment but have never used it \u201cresponsibly\u201d. I want to believe that I\u2019m not physically abusive but I feel like I\u2019m borderline and have, shamefully, crossed that line a few times. So maybe the term \u201cborderline\u201d is just self denial. I\u2019ve slapped each of them twice in their lives and each has been triggered by them screaming in my face. I don\u2019t know why that effects me the way it does but it\u2019s a noise I can\u2019t stand and I\u2019d do almost anything to make stop. Many times, during their screaming fits, I\u2019ve been able to keep it under control, but those few times, I failed. More often, I\u2019ve just treated them roughly, jerking or moving them harder than I should have. A few days ago, the three of us were on a playground when my son did something to his sister that prompted me to ask him nicely to apologize to her and he refused. I calmly asked him twice more and finally followed it up with, \u201cif you can\u2019t do that then we need to go home.\u201d He recently has seen The Peanut\u2019s Movie and picked up the term Blockhead, and so he responded to me, \u201cNo we\u2019re not, you Blockhead!\u201d I saw red, grabbed him by the wrist, and yanked him out of the alcove he was in so hard it lifted a 42 pound kid off his feet, hitting his other wrist against a bar pretty hard. I jerked him to his feet and stormed to the car with both kids wailing and other parents looking on. As with the other incidents, I\u2019m ashamed of myself. I hate myself for it and wish I had the balls to tell someone my own size so they could treat me accordingly. I deserve that. But here\u2019s the thing, and I wouldn\u2019t believe me if I\u2019d just read that either, but I love my kids with all my heart. I love my son\u2019s imagination and the random things he says from nowhere. He\u2019s so observant, misses nothing, and is so incredibly curious. He will ask questions nonstop for hours and it\u2019s fascinating to watch his understanding of the world develop. He\u2019s my little drama queen and prone to meltdowns but I\u2019ve always loved the bond he and I have had since before he was born. I read to him every night that I could when he was in the womb and minutes after he was born, he was under the heat lamp squalling away, when I came over, looked down at him, and said his name. He immediately stopped crying and began looking around for me. He already knew me, my voice. As long as I live, I will never forget that or stop cherishing that moment. I have genuine tears in my eyes as I say that. Thanks to their mother, both our kids are beautiful but my daughter is one of the most adorable little girls I\u2019ve ever seen, with her mom\u2019s looks and my wavy, curly hair. She\u2019s so independent but so loving and cuddly. When she belly laughs, she purrs at the end and it melts my heart. Until recently, she\u2019s been the opposite of her brother, very easy going and relaxed compared to his drama. She sleeps on my shoulder frequently and my arm could be on fire from holding her weight so long and I still love just having her there. They still love me, run to me when I come home or pick them up, and I..."

      "content": "Thank you for reaching out and sharing this with me. It took a tremendous amount of courage and vulnerability to write all of this out, especially given how much pain and self-loathing you are currently experiencing. Please know that I am here to listen without judgment.\n\nThe fact that you are so deeply ashamed and heartbroken over these incidents shows exactly how much you love your children and how desperately you want to be a better father. You are not a monster; you are a father who is struggling immensely with controlling intense reactions and overwhelming emotions, and that struggle is hurting both you and your family.\n\nLet\u2019s focus on the fact that you are actively seeking help and clarity right now. That is the most important step you can take.\n\nIt sounds like you are dealing with a few major, interconnected issues:\n\n1.  **Intense Emotional Dysregulation:** The explosive anger, the \"seeing red,\" the difficulty managing the constant noise and input (which you attribute to your ADD), and the descent into dark, angry moods.\n2.  **Harmful Reactions and Actions:** Yelling, treating them roughly, and the few times you\u2019ve crossed the line into physical discipline.\n3.  **Overwhelming Guilt and Shame:** This is causing you to hate yourself and feel disconnected from the loving, caring father you know you are and want to be.\n\nYou mentioned that you are looking for advice. To make sure I give you the most helpful guidance possible, I want to break down some immediate and long-term steps based on what you\u2019ve shared.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate Steps: Safety and Stabilization\n\nThe most critical thing right now is ensuring the safety and well-being of your children and yourself.\n\n### 1. **Zero Tolerance for Physical Action**\n\nYou mentioned that you have crossed the line a few times and that the noise of them screaming triggers a reaction you can't stand.\n\n*   **Commit to a zero-tolerance policy for *any* physical contact driven by anger.** This includes rough handling, jerking, or slapping. You must commit to this, knowing that the guilt you feel afterward is proof that these actions violate your core values as a parent.\n*   **Identify Your Trigger Escape Route:** When the noise or the disrespect (like the \"Blockhead\" incident) makes you \"see red,\" you need a pre-planned exit strategy. This is not about abandoning them; it\u2019s about protecting them from your reaction.\n    *   **The Script:** \"I am feeling very angry right now. I need to take a break. I will be back in two minutes.\"\n    *   **The Action:** Put them in a safe place (like a crib, playpen, or even just the living room floor if they are safe there), and immediately walk away into another room (bathroom, bedroom, garage).\n\n### 2. **Acknowledge the ADD Connection**\n\nYou made a very insightful observation about how your ADD affects your ability to manage the \"din\" of information and leads to the feeling of being overwhelmed and angry. This is a common experience for people with ADHD/ADD, where emotional regulation and sensory overload are huge challenges.\n\n*   **Seek Professional Diagnosis/Management:** If you are not currently being treated or managed for your ADD, this needs to be a priority. Talk to a doctor or psychiatrist about medication and/or therapy to manage the executive function deficits and emotional dysregulation that are fueling your anger. This is not an excuse, but it is a necessary part of the solution.\n\n---\n\n## Long-Term Strategies: Building Patience and Control\n\n### 3. **Therapy and Counseling**\n\nThis is non-negotiable for the deep work you need to do.\n\n*   **Individual Therapy:** Look for a therapist who specializes in **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** or **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**. These modalities are excellent for teaching practical skills for emotional regulation, managing intense anger, and changing automatic negative reactions. They can help you rewire the response pattern you learned in the past (throwing things, lashing out).\n*   **Parenting/Family Counseling:** A counselor can help you develop specific, non-violent, and effective discipline strategies for a five-year-old and a two-year-old. Learning *how* to handle a refusal, a meltdown, or a disrespectful comment without resorting to explosive anger is a skill that can be taught.\n\n### 4. **Mindfulness and Sensory Management**\n\nSince sensory overload (the \"room full of people talking\") is a key trigger, you need strategies to lower the noise level *before* it gets too loud.\n\n*   **Scheduled Breaks:** Even 5-10 minutes of quiet time, alone, while your wife watches the kids, or while they are watching a short show, can help reset your system. Don't wait until you are seeing red; take the break when you are at 50% capacity.\n*   **Use Noise-Canceling Tools:** If the screaming is truly unbearable, consider using noise-dampening earplugs (like Loop or similar brands) or noise-canceling headphones when you are supervising the children, especially during high-stress times (meal prep, bedtime, transition times). This can reduce the sensory input enough to keep you from \"seeing red.\"\n\n### 5. **Repair and Connection**\n\nYou mentioned how much you love your kids\u2014their curiosity, her purring laugh, the bond with your son. You must prioritize moments of positive connection to outweigh the negative interactions.\n\n*   **The 5:1 Ratio:** Psychologists suggest that for every negative interaction (yelling, correction, anger), you need five positive ones to keep the relationship healthy.\n*   **Special Time:** Dedicate 10-15 minutes every single day to each child, separately, doing whatever *they* want to do (reading, building, coloring). Put your phone away. This is your time to see the wonderful qualities you cherish, which will help you build empathy and patience when the hard moments come.\n*   **Repair After the Rupture:** When you do yell or react poorly, you must go back, apologize sincerely, and repair the relationship.\n    *   **Example Script:** \"I am so sorry I yelled at you earlier. That was my mistake. I was feeling frustrated and I lost control of my voice. It is never okay for me to yell at you. I love you, and I promise to try harder to use a calm voice next time.\"\n\n---\n\n## A Note on the Incident at the Playground\n\nThe incident where you grabbed your son was a moment where the *Blockhead* comment hit a deep trigger, and your reaction was far out of proportion to his behavior. The shame you feel is appropriate because the action was harmful, but it must be used as fuel for change, not self-destruction.\n\n**What to do now:**\n\n1.  **Apologize to your son specifically for the roughness.** Use the repair script above, explaining that you hurt his arm and that you were wrong to grab him like that.\n2.  **Develop a new plan for disrespect.** A five-year-old calling you a name is testing boundaries. A calm response could be: \"I don't like that word, and we don't call people names in our family. We can try that sentence again, or we can go home.\" If he still refuses, the consequence (going home) happens calmly, without the grabbing or yelling.\n\nYou are struggling, and you are hurting, but you are not beyond help. The love you feel for your children is evident in every word you wrote, and that love is the foundation on which you will build a healthier, calmer version of yourself.\n\n**What is the very first step you feel ready to take right now?** Is it calling your doctor about the ADD management, or is it reaching out to a therapist?"
